Joe Biden, citing 'economic imperative', orders faster relief checks, more food aid

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the faster issuance of pandemic stimulus checks to needy families and increased food aid for children who normally rely on school meals, an effort to ease Americansâ burdens while Congress negotiates over his proposed $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package. In the opening days of his administration, Biden is emphasizing that the government must tackle the coronavirus crisis with urgency after his predecessor Donald Trump largely played it down. More than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus and millions of jobs have been lost. âItâs not just to meet the moral obligation,â Biden said in remarks at a White House event to sign two executive orders. âThis is an economic imperative.â Biden said his stimulus package to address the economic effects of the pandemic has support from business, labor, Wall Street and Main Street. âA lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. ... Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act,â Biden said. Republican lawmakers have questioned the price tag on pandemic aid and a separate investment proposal for infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research. Biden says we need to act 'decisively and boldly'Earlier on Friday, White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese said he would speak with lawmakers on Sunday to push for relief. âWeâre at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. Without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in,â Deese said. Bidenâs actions were not a substitute for legislative relief, Deese said, with about 16 million people now receiving some type of unemployment benefit and an estimated 29 million who do not have enough to eat. A major pillar of the Biden plan is greatly increasing the number of people who are being vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. In December, Biden set a goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office and on Friday he spoke of exceeding that number. âWeâre going to, God willing, not only do 100 million, weâre going do more than that,â he said. The US Centers for Disease Control said it had administered 19.1 million doses of the vaccine as of Friday. Women, minorities and low-income service workers have been disproportionately hurt, with Black and Hispanic workers facing higher jobless rates than white workers. In an early test of whether Republicans might support Democrat Bidenâs plans for coronavirus relief, infrastructure investment and tax increases, the US Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously on Friday to approve Janet Yellen, Bidenâs choice for Treasury Secretary, paving the way for her confirmation by the full chamber. Bidenâs hopes for speedy action on his legislative agenda and Cabinet appointments are complicated by the expected trial of Trump in the Senate as early as next week and bipartisan squabbling over operations in an evenly split Senate. In an executive order on Friday, Biden asked the Treasury Department to consider taking steps to expand and improve delivery of stimulus checks, such as by establishing online tools for claiming payments. Biden also said that under his executive order he expected the Department of Labor âto guarantee the right to refuse employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so youâll still be able to qualify for (unemployment) insurance.â Unemployment benefits are largely administered by the states, which set their own eligibility requirements, and it was unclear how the federal agency would put this directive into effect. Biden is also asking the agriculture department to consider issuing new guidance to increase the aid given to families who normally rely on schools to provide a daily main meal for their children. It could provide a family with three children more than $100 of additional support every two months.

NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel prices in the country on Saturday touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week. Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies. This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to Rs 92.28. Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.88 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed. This is the second consecutive day of rate increase and the fourth this week. In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week. Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts. Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out. State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Since then, rates have gone up by Rs 1.99 a litre on petrol and Rs 2.01 in case of diesel. This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India. Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later. This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far. Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

NEW DELHI: State-owned Coal India Ltd on Saturday said that it is well geared to meet any surge in demand for coal from the power sector. The statement follows power demand touching an all-time high of 187.3 GW on Friday. "CIL (Coal India) is well geared to meet any surge in demand for the dry fuel from the power sector especially on the back of close to 63 million tonnes stock at its pitheads," the PSU said in a statement. The company is also pushing ahead for increased production, committed to shoring up the supplies to coal-fuelled power plants. In this backdrop, close to 67 per cent of the total coal-fired power generation in the country is fuelled through CIL's supplies. Of the 199 GW of coal-based power programmed for generation per day during the ongoing fiscal, 133 GW is scheduled from CIL linked coal. Average coal-based power generation of power per day which was 2.795 BU till Friday spurted up to 3.072 BU, a jump of nearly 10 per cent on the morning of the record making day. Coal-based power generation remains consistently high among all other categories. "This increase in coal-based power generation bodes well for us. If this continues, we could expect our supplies to power sector go up in near future," the company said adding that the power plants need to submit adequate programme at the coal companies to avoid any shortage of dry fuel as the demand started peaking. Coal India is focusing on ramping up its supplies to pithead based power plants to higher levels. This would influence in cost per unit of power generated coming down. Coal transportation cost to pithead power plants is comparably lower than long distanced based ones, making the landed cost of coal lower. This in turn makes the generation cost economical. Coal-based power generation accounted for 78.6 per cent of the country's total generation on Friday when all India peak power demand, which is the highest supply in a day, surged to a new record of 187.3 GW in the morning eclipsing the previous high of 185.82 GW recorded on January 20. Of the total 3.906 billion units (BU) generated on Friday, coal-fired generation chipped in the bulk with 3.072 BU.

NEW DELHI: Telcos have asked the government to clarify about the entity that will be held liable if there is security breach in the network post implementation of National Security Directive (NSD) on the telecom sector, according to industry sources aware of the development. The telecom operators have given their input to the government in a meeting called by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) about one-and-a-half weeks back, industry sources told PTI. "A meeting was called to work on road map for trusted products by the NSCS. Senior regulatory officials of telecom service providers attended the meeting and gave their inputs. Telcos wanted the government to come out with clear guidelines on who will be responsible for breach in the network if the government is making a list of trusted products that have to be deployed in the network," a private operator official told PTI. Under the current rules, telecom operators are held responsible if there is any security breach in their network. Another private operator representative said that two private mobile service providers want the government to ensure price competitiveness among vendors in case equipment from China are barred from the networks. "It was suggested that the price competitiveness can be maintained by way of reducing import duties. Nokia and Ericsson have told government officials that the prices of their telecom gears will come down as they are manufacturing in India and saving on import duty," the representative said. In a bid to tighten security of communications network, the government on December 16 had announced the National Security Directive on Telecommunication Sector, which will mandate service providers to purchase equipment from trusted sources. Notably, Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei has had its run-ins in the past with governments of Canada and the US. The US has alleged that it did not comply with its cybersecurity and privacy laws leaving the country and the citizens vulnerable to espionage. There have been several reports claiming that India will likely cut Huawei gear from telecom network. The meeting was attended by representatives from industry body COAI, Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. Telecom equipment companies were not part of the said meeting, the source said.

MANGALURU: Businesses and trade in India will have to learn to change faster than the change itself if they want to succeed, Ajit Doval, National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of India, said at the Swami Vivekanand Memorial Lecture 2021 organized by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. He explained that it is important that to succeed Indian companies will have to remain a step ahead of others. âBy 2030, 600 million people will be living and operating from their homes. The new urban complexes will have to ensure that the industrial economy from residential centers can adjust. Also, many people are moving back to the villages. Can we ensure that these villages are developed into new hubs for economic activity? Can they be equipped with better connectivity and infrastructure,â he said. The most enduring message of Covid-19 is that only the well-being of all will ensure our survival. âThose who have funds and are better off should expand their outlook so that it touches the lives of everyone. This is what Swami Vivekanand also said, that if you want to find God, you need to serve man,â he pointed out. Swami Vivekanand took a very holistic view of life. âFor him a person playing football would be nearer to heaven than one chanting the Bhagavad Gita. He understood that every Individual and nation needed to take care of its basic material requirement to exist and progress. No spiritual alleviation or growth was possible when the basic survival was threatened,â he said. India has besides geographical proximity to many markets, it has many natural advantages. âAs a geostrategic environment, Indiaâs growing multi-sectoral cooperation with the Middle East will provide several opportunities in the fields of infrastructure, tourism, and establishing a third country joint venture,â he said. Multitudes of reforms are brought by the government that will benefit in the long run. ââAtmanirbhar Bharatâ is a new window of opportunity for India. We have to become global leaders in the future. Let us all join hands and build a new and strong India,â he said. Vineet Agrawal, President, ASSOCHAM stated that Swami Vivekananda was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator, and passionate patriot. âHis teachings have been an inspiration to many, and his words have become self-improvement goals, especially for the youth of the country. For this very reason, his birthday, January 12, is celebrated as the National Youth Day in India. We are all motivated by his inspiring speech at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago, 1893, which changed how the world viewed religion,â he said. At a time when the world is reeling under the impact of the pandemic, Swami Vivekanandaâs teachings can help bring order to the chaos and encourage us to look to the Indian heritage as a binding factor for global collaborations, Agrwal said. Sumant Sinha, senior vice-president, ASSOCHAM stated that Swami Vivekananda's concept of 'potential the divinity of the soul' gives a new, ennobling concept of man. âThe present age is the age of humanism which holds that man should be the chief concern and center of all activities and thinking. Through science and technology, man has attained great prosperity and power, and modern communication and travel methods have converted human society into a 'global village',â he said. Deepak Sood, secretary-general, ASSOCHAM stated that society is guided by Swamijiâs focus on the spirit of oneness, the importance of a good education system and human development in building a nation, and how service to humanity can help individuals become the best versions of themselves. âIncidentally, today is also Parakram Diwas, the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. He has also inspired us, much like Swami Vivekanand, with his indomitable spirit and selfless service to the nation. The values of these leaders continue to inspire people of our country to act with fortitude in the face of adversity,â Mr Sood stated.

NEW DELHI: Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday threw a googly at the steel industry, saying his ministry will allow use of âsynthetic fibreâ and âcomposite fibreâ bars in place of steel products for building roads and bridges to reduce cost in the face of âartificialâ hike in price of the key construction raw material. Addressing the Foundation Day of an industry house in Mumbai, Gadkari said the steel industry has increased the prices which is ânot justifiedâ considering that there has been no escalation in labour, raw material and power costs. âEvery steel producer has got its own iron ore mines. So, jacking up prices is a type of black marketing and the cement industry is also habitual of this. I am going to settle my issue with them. Now we are planning to allow synthetic fibre in place of steel. There has been a lot of inventions and now we will allow this for bridge and road construction,â the minister said. Big steel, cement firms operating as a cartel; need to place regulator: Nitin GadkariGadkari said he has been constantly pursuing the matter and he will see that the steel manufacturers reduce the prices. âNearly 40% of the steel and cement are used in highway construction. If they donât reduce prices, we will formulate alternative policies,â he warned. Synthetic fibre and composite fibre bars are being used in different parts of the world and this can reduce the requirement of steel in construction projects. Being corrosion-proof and light, these are emerging as alternatives to steel, though these cannot replace steel completely. Top civil engineers in the government and private sectors said there have been several innovations and use of synthetic fibre, composite fibre bars and fibre-reinforced concrete is catching up. âBut there are some issues that need to be addressed. Most of the structures we are building should have at least 100 years of life. So far, there is hardly any trial of the composite fibre or synthetic fibre for 20-30 years. There is a need to try the products and see their performance,â said an engineer who didnât wish to be identified. The government is now allowing private players to use new technologies and materials in their projects, which have been tried and tested. In such a case, the companies will take responsibility any defect under the âdefect liability clauseâ. A senior engineer from a private company said, âIn all government-funded projects, the defect liability is only for 10 years in case of a standalone structure and for all others itâs five years. So, we need to try before giving the go-ahead to such materials,â he added.

NEW DELHI: Frontline workers in the aviation sector should be considered for Covid-19 vaccination on priority basis after health workers have been given the jabs, the civil aviation ministry has told the Union health ministry. As per the guidelines issued by the health ministry on December 28 last year, initially around 30 crore Indians will be vaccinated, including around three crore healthcare and frontline workers, and approximately 27 crore people of over the age of 50 years. The frontline workers mentioned in the December 28 guidelines does not include aviation sector employees but personnel from the armed forces, prison staff, municipal workers, among others. In a letter dated January 20, 2021, Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Pradeep Singh Kharola told his counterpart in the health ministry Rajesh Bhushan: "You will agree with me that the crew, engineers, technicians, ground staff, frontline workers in aviation have certain risk elements while performing their duties in a most diligent manner and make air transportation a safe mode of transport." Recently, airlines and airports had approached MoCA and highlighted the need to vaccinate their staff on priority basis, albeit once the medical personnel are covered, Kharola mentioned in the letter, which has been accessed by the PTI. "Considering that the front line workers of airlines and airports are also involved in movement of vaccines, this MoCA recognizes the merit in the proposal and requests the MoHFW (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) to include front line workers of airlines and airports along with front line workers mentioned in the operational guidelines released on December 28, 2020," he added. If the request is considered favourably, MoCA would coordinate for enumeration of these personnel to be covered under the vaccination programme, Kharola noted. He said airlines and airports have been in forefront in extending their services to the passengers and movement of cargo within the country and across the borders.

This is largely driven by rural and semi-urban housing demand, pick-up in government led infrastructure aided incremental cement demand. And pent-up urban demand is expected to improve with the gradual return of the migrant workforce. Its consolidated net sales stood at Rs 12,144 crore, as against Rs 10,261 crore over the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, UltraTechâs Board approved capex of Rs 5,477 crore towards increasing the companyâs capacity by 12.8 mtpa with a mix of brown field and green field expansion. The additional capacity is being created in the fast-growing markets of the east, central and north regions of the country, the company said in a statement.  âThis expansion is in addition to the companyâs 6.7 mtpa capacity addition that is currently underway in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal, which has picked up pace and is expected to get commissioned by FY22, in a phased manner,â it said. Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, the companyâs capacity will grow to 136.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third largest cement company in the world, outside of China. Recovery from the Covid-19 led disruption of the economy has been rapid. This has been fuelled by quicker demand stabilisation, supply side restoration and greater cost efficiencies.

The government is expected to lay out a hefty borrowing plan in a February 1 Budget outline for the fiscal year from April, aimed at reviving an economy that has shrunk dramatically from the impact of COVID-19, squeezing tax revenues. This will complicate the Reserve Bank of India's task in drawing down the huge surplus of cash it pumped into the financial system to boost retail lending at the height of the pandemic, economists say. "The authorities walk a tightrope in incremental efforts to pare the extent of the liquidity surplus yet minimise reaction in (pushing up) borrowing costs as the overall policy bias remains accommodative," said Radhika Rao, an economist with DBS Bank. The RBI's problem was evident last week when it drained liquidity with a 14-day variable rate reverse repo auction, only to spook the market and drive up yields across the curve, forcing the bank to reverse course with an open market purchase of bonds to calm investors. "The RBI is well aware of the economic situation and won't rush to reverse the high level of liquidity in the system," said a person familiar with RBI thinking. "But measures taken last year were due to the exceptional conditions prevailing then, and it is only prudent to prepare and gradually restore things back to normal." The RBI has repeatedly said it will ensure ample liquidity in the banking system for lending to productive sectors, and to ensure the government's borrowing programme goes through smoothly, which will require keeping yields in check. The central bank said it was now looking to restore normal liquidity operations and announced the 14-day reverse repo while saying at the same time it would ensure ample liquidity as needed. The mixed messages confused the market, causing yields to spike. Analysts later determined the RBI was only seeking to address liquidity imbalances not tighten the cash supply. They think it will be months before the RBI can substantially reduce the average daily surplus of 6 trillion rupees ($8 billion) that banks park with the RBI. But the unexpectedly high cut-off yield set at the 14-day reverse repo auction raised worries that the RBI may eventually raise the reverse repo rate. Traders said RBI should set lower cut-offs at rollover auctions to allay these fears. "They should continue to roll over these 14-day reverse repos," said Bekxy Kuriakose, head of fixed income at Principal Asset Management. "It has helped anchor the overnight rates close to the reverse repo." The market consensus is that the RBI will need to continue supporting the market through "twist" operations - simultaneously buying and selling bonds - and outright bond purchases to avoid a spike in long-end yields and help banks absorb the fresh debt supply from the government. "Actions are needed to communicate that there will not be liquidity or financial tightening," said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. "We are still far from that state, which is neither optimal nor desirable at the current juncture."

MUMBAI: The Budget must redirect the government focus in resolving demand-side issues by moving away from fixing supply side problem which has been the focus since March when the pandemic began to pummel the economy, says a report. The pandemic induced lockdowns resulted in the economy tanking 23.9 per cent in the June quarter but made a dramatic recovery with the contraction improving to just 7.5 per cent in Q2 and is likely to re-enter the green zone in the second half which may help the economy close FY21 with a contraction of 7.5-8 per cent. "It is high time to change gears and focus on the demand side as well, lest the ongoing recovery begins to lose steam. There is nothing wrong in addressing the supply-side issues, as it was necessary to restore/augment the broken supply chains. But, lack of adequate demand may jeopardise the recovery and may even lead to a second-round impact," Sunil Kumar Sinha of India Ratings warned in a note on Friday. It can be noted that since 2012, consumption demand has been the one of the biggest missing links in an economy that was nearly overheated after the heavy stimulus doses following the 2008 global financial crisis, making companies eschew investments and halt expansions, resulting in lower wage increases and job creation leading to a massive fall in consumption demand. Sinha warned that even if the supply-side bottlenecks get restored on account of various government/RBI measures it may soon run into difficulties due to the lack of adequate demand for goods and services. "The economy has shown some green shoots with several high frequency indicators reaching the pre-pandemic level of production, bolstered by a combination of festive/pent-up demand. But, after two consecutive months of positive growth, the factory output contracted in November, showing the fragility of the recovery. Therefore an appropriate demand-side measure therefore is as important as supply-side measures," he said. Expecting the Budget, to be tabled on February 1, to focus on boosting aggregate demand, expenditure reprioritisation and mobilising higher non-tax revenue, Sinha lists the following priorities. Increase infra spend especially that are employment intensive and have a shorter turnaround time; set up a development financial institution on the lines of the erstwhile ICICI, IDBI and IFCI which can have patient capital or bring in the same; continue with the ongoing relief/income support to the poor households; allocate more funds to MGNREGA as it provides a safety net not only to rural households but also to the workers who migrated back to rural areas. Extend more support to real estate, especially affordable housing segment; since micro small and medium enterprises still face headwinds in securing finance, they need to get continued government support to remain afloat in FY22. Another key area is to reprioritise both revenue and capital expenditure towards essentials, giving priority to mass vaccination/public health. Similarly the budget must rationalise/discontinue schemes/sub-schemes that have meagre resource allocation. The budget must also take measures to mobilise higher non-tax revenue to fund expenditure and finally states must be given adequate money and assured of Central support when needed as most of the spending happens at the states. If the government accepts some of these, "we see nominal GDP clipping at 14 per cent (real GDP at 9.5-10 per cent in FY22 and fiscal deficit of 6.2 per cent of GDP", he said.

NEW DELHI: Telcos have asked the government to clarify about the entity that will be held liable if there is security breach in the network post implementation of National Security Directive (NSD) on the telecom sector, according to industry sources aware of the development. The telecom operators have given their input to the government in a meeting called by the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) about one-and-a-half weeks back, industry sources told PTI. "A meeting was called to work on road map for trusted products by the NSCS. Senior regulatory officials of telecom service providers attended the meeting and gave their inputs. Telcos wanted the government to come out with clear guidelines on who will be responsible for breach in the network if the government is making a list of trusted products that have to be deployed in the network," a private operator official told PTI. Under the current rules, telecom operators are held responsible if there is any security breach in their network. Another private operator representative said that two private mobile service providers want the government to ensure price competitiveness among vendors in case equipment from China are barred from the networks. "It was suggested that the price competitiveness can be maintained by way of reducing import duties. Nokia and Ericsson have told government officials that the prices of their telecom gears will come down as they are manufacturing in India and saving on import duty," the representative said. In a bid to tighten security of communications network, the government on December 16 had announced the National Security Directive on Telecommunication Sector, which will mandate service providers to purchase equipment from trusted sources. Notably, Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei has had its run-ins in the past with governments of Canada and the US. The US has alleged that it did not comply with its cybersecurity and privacy laws leaving the country and the citizens vulnerable to espionage. There have been several reports claiming that India will likely cut Huawei gear from telecom network. The meeting was attended by representatives from industry body COAI, Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. Telecom equipment companies were not part of the said meeting, the source said.

NEW DELHI: Passengers travelling to the Netherlands are now required to undergo a Covid test within four hours of their flight departure time at the origin. This is in addition to the existing requirement of getting the RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of arrival time in Holland. A negative result from the new 4-hour pre-departure test will be needed to board flights to Netherlands. The rule is effective immediately and is the latest in the tightening of testing norms by various countries after the emergence of new and more infectious strains of Coronavirus. "Cost of the (new 4-hour) test will be borne by passengers. They are requested to arrive at the airport 5-6 hours prior as check-in will be permitted only after obtaining the test result," KLM said in a travel advisory issued Saturday. Holland's four-hour is the shortest pre-departure testing time that ranges from 96 to 48 hours for other countries. "The latest advisory by the government of the Netherlands requires all passengers arriving in the Netherlands effective January 23, 2021, to undergo a rapid antigen test within 4 hours prior to departure," KLM India tweeted on Saturday. India has an air bubble arrangement with the Netherlands and France and Air France-KLM operate flights under that along with Air India. From India, KLM says it "has made arrangements with the labs at the airport. KLM globally has made network adjustments, at the moment India operations are as scheduled." The four-hour pre-departure test is mandatory for all passengers going to Amsterdam, including transit flyers. "This (4-hour) test is in addition to the existing mandatory RT-PCR test (maximum 72 hours prior arrival in Netherlands) regulations and test requirements. For departures ex India, KLM has made arrangements with the laboratories at the airport for the administration of the required antigen test" a travel advisory by KLM says. These arrangements have been made at airports of Indian cities to which KLM currently operate like Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Due to the fast evolving nature of countries' responses to the Covid outbreak, all passengers are personally responsible to ascertain eligibility based on entry requirements for transit and destination countries, it adds. An increasing number of countries are tightening their Covid norms after the new and more infectious strains began to emerge. Lufthansa Group will require all passengers and crew to wear medical protective category â and not everyday use â masks from February 1. The new rule, applicable on all Lufthansa Group airlines on flights to and from Germany. Lufthansa operates flights to and from India under an air bubble arrangement. From February 1, âpassengers will be required to wear either a surgical mask or an FFP2 mask or mask with the KN95/N95 standard during boarding, the flight and when leaving the aircraft. Everyday masks are then no longer permitted,â Lufthansa said in a statement on Friday. UK and US have asked passengers flying there to test negative for Covid before being allowed on flights headed there.

NEW DELHI: State-owned Coal India Ltd on Saturday said that it is well geared to meet any surge in demand for coal from the power sector. The statement follows power demand touching an all-time high of 187.3 GW on Friday. "CIL (Coal India) is well geared to meet any surge in demand for the dry fuel from the power sector especially on the back of close to 63 million tonnes stock at its pitheads," the PSU said in a statement. The company is also pushing ahead for increased production, committed to shoring up the supplies to coal-fuelled power plants. In this backdrop, close to 67 per cent of the total coal-fired power generation in the country is fuelled through CIL's supplies. Of the 199 GW of coal-based power programmed for generation per day during the ongoing fiscal, 133 GW is scheduled from CIL linked coal. Average coal-based power generation of power per day which was 2.795 BU till Friday spurted up to 3.072 BU, a jump of nearly 10 per cent on the morning of the record making day. Coal-based power generation remains consistently high among all other categories. "This increase in coal-based power generation bodes well for us. If this continues, we could expect our supplies to power sector go up in near future," the company said adding that the power plants need to submit adequate programme at the coal companies to avoid any shortage of dry fuel as the demand started peaking. Coal India is focusing on ramping up its supplies to pithead based power plants to higher levels. This would influence in cost per unit of power generated coming down. Coal transportation cost to pithead power plants is comparably lower than long distanced based ones, making the landed cost of coal lower. This in turn makes the generation cost economical. Coal-based power generation accounted for 78.6 per cent of the country's total generation on Friday when all India peak power demand, which is the highest supply in a day, surged to a new record of 187.3 GW in the morning eclipsing the previous high of 185.82 GW recorded on January 20. Of the total 3.906 billion units (BU) generated on Friday, coal-fired generation chipped in the bulk with 3.072 BU.

As we go into Budget 2021, even within the context of a shrinking budgetary allocation for education (as percentage of GDP) in the last years, I still have a dream. Actually, a long wishlist. If even 50% of this is touched, it will be cause for (cautious) celebration. For the magic is always found in, or missing from, the last mile. And we have miles to go. Beginning with the most exciting thing to happen in education in recent times â the new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP) â letâs look at a few of the needs it has thrown up that all require significant financial and other scaffolding. As always, I remain implementation and outcomes-focused. Provide a practical and usable NEP implementation roadmap NEP suggests an increase in education spend from 10 per cent of government public expenditure to 20 percent by 2030. So of course weâre expecting to see this intent begin to reflect positively in the 2021 Budget. But where this spend needs to be prioritized should be discussed clearly as well â direction must be provided for short-term focus areas. We are looking to the policy makers to help break the gigantic NEP dream map into bite-sizes that can be taken forward at state level and in the last mile, by the last principal/dean/teacher, positively impacting the last student in that mile. Money set aside needs to be clearly disbursed for specific heads by outcomes, and a measurement system put in place to check progress on spend versus impact. Focus on sector research, data, efficacy and improvementâ¦ at speed The implementation, the âhowâ of the NEP has to be the focus. It begins for all of us with the peeling back of each NEP goal to its smallest âoutcome,â and then setting in place the machinery to achieve those outcomes in small pockets. We already have excellent data on the education sector gathered by the government and ancillary or independent bodies. Now we must dive into that data to identify the most critical needs-gaps and address those in the shortest possible time, iteratively; we cannot afford to get caught in analysis paralysis, or wait for big bang catch-all solutions. To move forward at speed, a huge and concerted effort must be put in place through private-govt partnership. Partner agencies will be required to conduct research, gain insight from data, set up outcomes, monitor and evaluate progress, report impact and provide actionables if the government wants quick and visible improvement towards its education goals. We would like to see close ties with philanthropic and social impact sector. Iterative improvement and impact creates a story that enthuses people and makes distant or even overwhelming goals appear reachable. It creates a virtuous cycle of possibility, an opportunity to onboard more minds and hands. The government would want to create these stories. Kickstart teacher training on war footingEducators urgently need professional upskilling in the emerging industry and technology scenario, as well as emotional management skills and support. Both areas are critical for the future of our children and our economy. As evidenced during the pandemic core months, teachers are more than willing to revise their skill base when it is obvious that their very survival (and that of the ecosystem that sustains them) depends on it. We must leverage this positive mindset and momentum! This is the ideal time for, again, private-govt partnerships to build next-level teacher skills. A good percentage of the budget MUST be set aside for this to make it attractive for the best pedagogy and skills organisations out there to pitch in. Bear in mind that NEP demands a different approach that teachers will have to be trained for, and the shift will need considerable efforts at scale. Build future-facing content and resources The government should strategically stay away from any plans to force only a particular set of books & resources on educational Institutions. This, as debated earlier by us in industry, is a sure way to kill creative competition in the publishing world that makes nextgen content and methodology accessible to everyone. If we wish to disseminate only âaâ set of resources for certain grades, there is need for advanced level effort to continuously create and improve said resources, ensuring the global standards that competing publishers must typically pass on to consumers for their own survival. NEP outcomes necessitate a complete overhaul of instructional design, resources and implementation to shift both pedagogy and content/resources towards achieving those outcomes. A quick example is flexible learning tracks â how do we actualize this, and at scale? To meet such needs, an immediate influx of funds for appropriate labs, resources, and strong administrative as well as creative leadership is imperative. Now, a few non-NEP areas of importance. Incentivise skilling service providers Include professional and Life skilling within supplementary education sector, and then give appropriate reliefs to the sector to encourage players to come forward massively to enhance the skill level of youth across industries. Go-to skills mentioned by World Eonomic Forum are important to develop. But whereâs the incentive for smaller players to serve the masses, which requires considerable manpower and infrastructure investment? Make learning accessible for more learnersSupport student loans, student housingâ¦ everything that enables parents to send their children, especially first generation learners, to learning Institutions or gain access through other indirect means. Importantly, a forward-thinking influx of funds is urgently required to make technology access possible for all. This has been the biggest acute and visible problem during the pandemic around the world, not just in India, but it is perhaps more critical for a country like ours, sitting on a demographic advantage, than in many other parts of the world. It would be a pity to not leverage the demographic dividend. Or the evolved teaching fraternity, or the infrastructure, even barebones edtech capability, that most people have developed in the last year; fate has created a âplatformâ, and we must leap off it quickly and keep up the momentum. This time round, letâs design systems to be future-facing as well as accommodating of all stakeholdersâ needs-gaps. Better financial safeguarding for education institutions The regulations that bind institutions need a closer look, especially when it comes to their finances and management. Allow Institutions to create a bigger corpus than currently allowed, to face force majeure situations with less severe impact on all stakeholders. And in the meantime, provide sufficient and immediate injection to help employ/re-employ teachers, catch up with financial loss in the fees fracas, and step up infrastructure to meet access and outcome goals in the revised educational scenario. Adopt systemic redesignLastly, design thinking as a discipline must be applied to the education sector. A holistic look, future thinking, peeling back to current status, needs-gaps, prototyping, testing, implementing â without these, future-facing education and in particular meeting NEP goals will take decades. A systemic approach and applying Design Thinking might just make a dent in ten years. We need a dedicated department for this, please. Overall, philanthropy and private-public partnerships can play a major role in expanding the governmentâs capability to address the most critical needs quickly, and in conclusion, these may be the most important areas to kick off post-Budget. The rest would likely flow, and fast, from there. Now educationists, core and supplementary education providers, in fact anyone having anything to do with education are all excitedly waiting for the big reveal! Personally, I am positive and optimistic about the possibilities. (By Sharbari Purkayastha, EdTech, Academics, Design and Education Management expert. The views expressed are personal.)

NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel prices in the country on Saturday touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week. Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies. This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to Rs 92.28. Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.88 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed. This is the second consecutive day of rate increase and the fourth this week. In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week. Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts. Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out. State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Since then, rates have gone up by Rs 1.99 a litre on petrol and Rs 2.01 in case of diesel. This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India. Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later. This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far. Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

Railway Budget 2021 may throw more light on Indian Railways plan to introduce new bullet train networks in the coming years. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget 2021 on February 1. Railway Budget 2021 will be a part of the Union Budget. Recently, Indian Railways released its draft National Rail Plan 2024 which proposed almost 8,000 kilometres of bullet train network across the country by 2051. At present, India's maiden high-speed rail network is under construction between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. Facing land acquisition hurdles, particularly in Maharashtra, the bullet train network may be made operational only in Gujarat to begin with. Last year, FM Sitharaman had announced in her Budget speech that the high-speed train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad would be "actively pursued" by Indian Railways. ALSO READ | Railway Budget 2021: Where does Indian Railways stand on Budget proposal to introduce modern trains?But even as it looks to complete the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, Indian Railways has already entrusted NHSRCL with the task of preparing detailed project reports for seven high-speed rail corridors. The Detailed Project Report for the Delhi-Varanasi bullet train corridor via Ayodhya has already been submitted to the Ministry of Railways in October 2020. The over 800 km Delhi-Varanasi bullet train corridor will connect major cities like Lucknow, Mathura, Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Agra, Etawah, Raebareli and Bhadohi enroute. Meanwhile, the National Rail Plan 2024 has also proposed new bullet train corridors; Varanasi-Patna, Amritsar-Jammu, Patna-Guwahati, Hyderabad-Bangalore being some of the prominent ones. Below are the full details of the Indian Railways draft proposal on bullet train corridors in India.   Railway Budget was merged with the Union Budget a few years ago and from 2017 it was presented as a part of the Budget speech. While no new trains are announced in the Budget speech since then, the Finance Minister does emphasise on Indian Railways plans to introduce modern, world-class trains for enhanced passenger comfort. With the National Rail Plan 2024 stressing on the need for high-speed rail corridors, new bullet train corridors may find mention in Sitharaman's speech this year.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the faster issuance of pandemic stimulus checks to needy families and increased food aid for children who normally rely on school meals, an effort to ease Americansâ burdens while Congress negotiates over his proposed $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package. In the opening days of his administration, Biden is emphasizing that the government must tackle the coronavirus crisis with urgency after his predecessor Donald Trump largely played it down. More than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus and millions of jobs have been lost. âItâs not just to meet the moral obligation,â Biden said in remarks at a White House event to sign two executive orders. âThis is an economic imperative.â Biden said his stimulus package to address the economic effects of the pandemic has support from business, labor, Wall Street and Main Street. âA lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. ... Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act,â Biden said. Republican lawmakers have questioned the price tag on pandemic aid and a separate investment proposal for infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research. Biden says we need to act 'decisively and boldly'Earlier on Friday, White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese said he would speak with lawmakers on Sunday to push for relief. âWeâre at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. Without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in,â Deese said. Bidenâs actions were not a substitute for legislative relief, Deese said, with about 16 million people now receiving some type of unemployment benefit and an estimated 29 million who do not have enough to eat. A major pillar of the Biden plan is greatly increasing the number of people who are being vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. In December, Biden set a goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office and on Friday he spoke of exceeding that number. âWeâre going to, God willing, not only do 100 million, weâre going do more than that,â he said. The US Centers for Disease Control said it had administered 19.1 million doses of the vaccine as of Friday. Women, minorities and low-income service workers have been disproportionately hurt, with Black and Hispanic workers facing higher jobless rates than white workers. In an early test of whether Republicans might support Democrat Bidenâs plans for coronavirus relief, infrastructure investment and tax increases, the US Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously on Friday to approve Janet Yellen, Bidenâs choice for Treasury Secretary, paving the way for her confirmation by the full chamber. Bidenâs hopes for speedy action on his legislative agenda and Cabinet appointments are complicated by the expected trial of Trump in the Senate as early as next week and bipartisan squabbling over operations in an evenly split Senate. In an executive order on Friday, Biden asked the Treasury Department to consider taking steps to expand and improve delivery of stimulus checks, such as by establishing online tools for claiming payments. Biden also said that under his executive order he expected the Department of Labor âto guarantee the right to refuse employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so youâll still be able to qualify for (unemployment) insurance.â Unemployment benefits are largely administered by the states, which set their own eligibility requirements, and it was unclear how the federal agency would put this directive into effect. Biden is also asking the agriculture department to consider issuing new guidance to increase the aid given to families who normally rely on schools to provide a daily main meal for their children. It could provide a family with three children more than $100 of additional support every two months.

A former Tesla Inc. software engineer was ordered to appear before a judge to face allegations that three days into his job, he started stealing confidential files and transferring them to a personal storage account. During his two-week employment ending Jan. 6, Alex Khatilov stole more than 6,000 scripts, or files of code, that automate a broad range of business functions, Tesla argues in its trade-secret theft complaint. Tesla convinced U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers that the threat posed is serious enough that she granted a restraining order Friday requiring Khatilov to immediately preserve and return all files, records and emails to the company and appear before her, remotely, on Feb. 4. Elon Muskâs electric-car maker has aggressively pursued lawsuits against other former employees and rival companies that it has accused of poaching engineers and stealing proprietary data. A software automation engineer, Khatilov was hired as one of a âselect few Tesla employeesâ to have access to the files, which the company says were unrelated to his job. Tesla says it had to sue because Khatilov lied about his theft and tried to delete evidence of it. Khatilov said he was surprised and shocked by Teslaâs lawsuit. He said in an interview that after he was hired on Dec. 28, Tesla sent him a file containing information for new hires. He said he transferred it to his personal Dropbox cloud account to use later on his personal computer. âNobody told me using Dropbox is prohibited,â Khatilov said. âI donât know why they claim itâs sensitive information, I didnât have access to any sensitive information.â Companies wanting to maintain protection over files normally block their improper installation, he added. Days later, Khatilov said he showed Tesla the information in his Dropbox when security asked, and deleted the data at the companyâs request. A few hours later Tesla called to tell him he was fired. According to Tesla, after investigators found thousands of confidential files in Khatilovâs personal storage, the engineer said he forgot about them and tried to destroy the data at the start of the interview. Tesla says it doesnât know if he previously copied or sent the files to other locations. Khatilov said in the interview that he didnât send them to anyone or anywhere. âThe scripts are extremely valuable to Tesla, and they would be to a competitor,â the company claimed in the lawsuit. âAccess to these scripts would enable engineers at other companies to reverse engineer Teslaâs processes to create a similar system in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the expense.â The New York Post reported on the case earlier.

NEW DELHI: A resurgence in real estate prices in Shanghai and Shenzhen has prompted authorities to rein in speculation, in line with the Chinese governmentâs resolve to keep the property market in check. Shanghai officials unveiled policies late on Thursday to cool the local market, including a measure designed to plug a loophole long exploited by buyers using fake divorces to become eligible to purchase more properties or obtain mortgages. The city will also levy a tax on sales of houses purchased within five years, up from the previous two-year barrier. This is âaimed at resolutely enforcing the decisions of the central committee of the Partyâ and âfirmly upholding the policy stance that âhouses are for inhabiting, not for speculationâ,â the Shanghai municipal government said in a statement, referring to President Xi Jinpingâs vow to boost housing affordability. With the new policy, Shanghai follows big cities including Shenzhen and Hangzhou to crack down on housing speculation via fake divorces since 2018, said Pan Hao, a property analyst at KE Holdings Inc. As most Chinese cities limit home-buying demand by capping the number of properties a family can own, divorce becomes a way to bypass the restriction. In Shanghai, local families are allowed to own two homes. Under the new rule, the number of homes owned by people who have been divorced for less than three years will be counted based on the total they had when they were still married. Shenzhen movesThe government of the southern boomtown of Shenzhen also moved to tighten home-purchase rules this month, according to local media reports. With the cost of an apartment equal to 43.5 times a residentâs average annual salary, Shenzhenâs housing affordability is little better than Hong Kong, the worst among 80 megacities, according to E-House (China) Enterprise Holdings Ltd, a real estate firm. Chinese authorities are determined to control housing risks after monetary easing spurred a rebound in the residential market. The central bank capped loans for the real estate sector earlier this month for the first time. Existing-home prices of certain popular projects in Shanghai surged more than 30% last year, according to China Real Estate Information Corp. Sales of existing homes in the city almost doubled last month from a year earlier, based on square-meter volume, according to KE Holdings. âStrong warningâThe new rules in Shanghai add to the tightening of cityâs already strict home-buying requirements. In 2016, it raised the down-payment threshold to as high as 70% of a residential propertyâs value to cool demand. The latest policy was rolled out faster than expected and âserves as a strong warning for other markets,â said Ding Zuyu, co-president of E-House. âIt may cool down Shanghaiâs home market in the short term,â he said, while adding that itâs unlikely to tank it because speculative purchases in the city âarenât that widespread.â Sinolink Securities Co said it expects residential property prices in Shanghai to rise further, albeit slowly, this year in spite of the latest cooling measures. Price growth in some central areas of the city could even accelerate, given that demand is robust there and the land to be supplied for future residential development is primarily located in the suburbs, it said in a research note.

Tesla Inc chief and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Thursday took to Twitter to promise a $100 million prize for development of the "best" technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions. Capturing planet-warming emissions is becoming a critical part of many plans to keep climate change in check, but very little progress has been made on the technology to date, with efforts focused on cutting emissions rather than taking carbon out of the air. The International Energy Agency said late last year that a sharp rise in the deployment of carbon capture technology was needed if countries are to meet net-zero emissions targets. "Am donating $100M towards a prize for best carbon capture technology," Musk wrote in a tweet, followed by a second tweet that promised "Details next week." Tesla officials did not immediately respond to a request for additional information. Musk, who co-founded and sold Internet payments company PayPal Holdings Inc, now leads some of the most futuristic companies in the world. Besides Tesla, he heads rocket company SpaceX and Neuralink, a startup that is developing ultra-high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers. Newly-sworn-in US President Joe Biden has pledged to accelerate the development of carbon capture technology as part of his sweeping plan to tackle climate change. On Thursday, he named Jennifer Wilcox, an expert in carbon removal technologies, as the principal deputy assistant secretary for fossil energy at the US Department of Energy.

OAKLAND: Google parent Alphabet Inc is shutting down its internet balloon business, Loon, which aimed to provide a less expensive alternative to cell towers, saying on Thursday that "the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped." Founded in 2011, Loon aimed to bring connectivity to areas of the world where building cell towers is too expensive or treacherous by using balloons the length of tennis courts to float solar-powered networking gear high above the Earth. But the wireless carriers that Loon saw as buyers of its technology have questioned its technical and political viability. "While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business," Loon chief executive Alastair Westgarth said in a blog post. Alphabet executive Astro Teller said in a separate blog post that despite Loon's "groundbreaking technical achievements" over the past nine years, "the road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped." Westgarth said Loon's legacy would include advancing helium balloons to last hundreds of days in the sky and developing communications equipment that could deliver cell coverage across an area 200 times bigger than an average tower can. But among challenges were that a carrier would need several balloons at once, and each balloon cost tens of thousands of dollars and lasted only about five months. Loon launched a pilot project in Kenya in 2020, years behind schedule after regulatory delays. Its partner, Telkom Kenya, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The technology previously proved successful in short projects to provide cell coverage in Peru and Puerto Rico when cell towers were downed by natural disasters. The company had pitched countries and international organizations on contracting with Loon to fly in during future emergencies, but gained little traction. Loon said it may share its technology with carriers, governments or nonprofit groups aiming to bring high-speed internet to the last few places in the world. The company employed 200 people as of 2019. It drew a $125 million investment that year from SoftBank’s HAPSMobile, which is working on floating cell equipment with drones. HAPSMobile declined to comment on the financial effect of Loon's shutdown but said it would "continue to work toward our goal of developing a commercial business." Separately, companies backed by billionaire entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, continue to look at offering internet connections using satellites in near-Earth orbit. Alphabet previously shuttered what it calls "other bets," or entities separate to Google, such as one working on power-generating kites. Alphabet has pressed some "bets" to raise funding from other investors or become self-sustaining. Loon struggled to attract investment. The company maintains at least one "bet" tackling the skies - Wing, which is aiming to commercialize goods delivery by drone.

Google threatens to block Australians over media law

SYDNEY: Google threatened Friday to block Australians from using its search service unless the government changed landmark legislation to make the internet giant pay news outlets for their content. Google Australia managing director Mel Silva warned a Senate committee in Canberra that the world-first media law was "unworkable" and would undermine the functioning of the internet. "If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia," Silva said, the first time the company has made such a threat after months of difficult negotiations over the draft law. Australian govt PR website given 'news' status by Google, FacebookThe legislation was introduced last year to force Google and Facebook to pay local media organisations to host news content or face millions of dollars in fines, in one of the most aggressive moves globally to check the power of the US tech giants. Under the laws, the firms would be required to compensate Australian media outlets, ranging from Rupert Murdoch's giant News Corp to public broadcasters ABC and SBS, for publishing snippets of their content in search results. The most controversial part of the law would require Google and Facebook to enter mandatory arbitration with media companies if they cannot reach agreement over the value of their content within three months. The arbiter would then choose between the payment proposal put forward by a news outlet and that coming from the tech firm. "This provision in the code would set an untenable precedent for our business and the digital economy," Silva said Friday. "It is not compatible with how search engines work or now the internet works." The law would also require the platforms to give the news businesses two weeks' notice of algorithm changes affecting the distribution of their content, and includes punitive clauses to stop the firms from blocking content to avoid payment. Google and Facebook have been backed in their opposition to the law by the US government and internet architects including Tim Berners-Lee. The initiative has been closely watched around the globe, as news media worldwide have suffered in an increasingly digital economy where big tech firms overwhelmingly capture advertising revenue. Efforts to confront the tech firms on behalf of beleaguered news media in Europe have focused mainly on copyright law and have had some limited success. But the Australian law relies on antitrust provisions and would have a more far-reaching financial impact on Google and Facebook. Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose conservative government has heeded demands by the country's biggest news organisations to crack down on the tech firms, responded sharply to the threat by Google, by far the dominant search engine in the country. "Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament," Morrison said. "People who want to work with that in Australia, you're very welcome, but we don't respond to threats." At Friday's hearing, Facebook similarly labelled the code "unworkable" in its current form and said it would cause the social media platform to stop publishing Australian news. "The great majority of people who are using Facebook would continue to be able to do so, but we would no longer be able to provide news," Facebook's Simon Milner told the hearing. Both companies stressed that they were willing to pay media companies for their content through various direct arrangements, including in products like Facebook News and Google News Showcase. And they proposed a series of amendments to the draft Australian law to avoid a showdown. "Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that Google wants to have happen, especially when there is another way forward," Silva said. "There is a clear pathway to a fair and workable code, with only slight amendments," she said. The key change demanded by the companies is to drop the mandatory arbitration process in favour of mediated negotiations with individual news organisations.

SYDNEY: Google and Facebook Inc have granted an Australian local government news provider status, drawing questions about the internet giants' efforts to curate news media. Bundaberg Council, a regional government, told Reuters a website it runs received classification as a Google "news source", making it the country's first local government with that accreditation. That means a council-funded website containing only public relations content gets priority in Google News searches about the agriculture hub of 100,000 people, accompanied by a "news source" tag. Bundaberg also has the country's only confirmed council-run Facebook page tagged as a "News & Media Website". Media payment law: Google threatens to shut search engine in AustraliaThe designation shows the gaps left in the country's traditional news market as smaller publications wither and disappear. Bundaberg Council's news website says it does not publish court and crime reports, politics, "investigative journalism" or "negative stories". "It's just another example of the way these tech giants are allowed to operate outside any accountability framework at all," said Denis Muller, an Honorary Fellow at University of Melbourne's Centre for Advancing Journalism. "If they want to classify a council PR website as a news website, well, they can, and there's nothing stopping them." Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook are fighting an Australian federal government plan to make them pay media outlets for original content that appears on their platforms, telling a Senate inquiry that the new rules may lead them to cancel some core services in the country. A Google representative did not respond to a separate Reuters request for comment on Friday. In a submission to the inquiry, Bundaberg Mayor Jack Dempsey said the new rules would "subsidise failed business models" and may have "unintended consequences, including ... damage to new media entrants and innovative publishing models such as Bundaberg Now". Bundaberg Council's executive officer of communications, Michael Gorey, told Reuters commercial media such as state broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp still provided news in the region "albeit with less coverage than several years ago". "Commercial media have a strong focus on news such as crime, tragedies and local politics which Bundaberg Now chooses not to report," he said in an email. "Bundaberg Now seeks to fill a gap in the media market with community news, local business and events. We see no evidence of market failure in Bundaberg to warrant federal government intervention". The City of Onkaparinga, in the country's south near Adelaide, started news website Onkaparinga Now in 2018. A representative said the council has not applied for official news provider status with Google or Facebook.

PARIS: Google and a French publishers' lobby said on Thursday they had agreed to a copyright framework for the US tech giant to pay news publishers for content online, in a first for Europe.

Facebook was not immediately reachable for comment. Alphabet-owned Google and the Alliance de la presse d'information gÃ©nÃ©rale (APIG) said in a statement that the framework included criteria such as the daily volume of publications, monthly internet traffic and "contribution to political and general information". Google has so far only signed licensing agreements with a few publications in France, including national daily newspapers Le Monde and Le Figaro.

Google and APIG did not say how much money would be distributed to APIG's members, who include most French national and local publishers. Details on how the remuneration would be calculated were not disclosed.

SYDNEY: Google said on Friday it will disable its search function in Australia if the government proceeds with a media code that would force it and Facebook Inc to pay local media companies for sharing their content. Australia is on course to pass laws that would make the Big Tech giants negotiate payments with local publishers and broadcasters for content. If they can't strike a deal, a government-appointed arbitrator will decide the price. "The code's arbitration model with bias criteria presents unmanageable financial and operational risk for Google," Mel Silva, managing director for Australia and New Zealand, told a senate committee. "If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia." Australia announced the legislation last month after an investigation found Alphabet Inc-owned Google and social media giant Facebook held too much market power in the media industry, a situation it said posed a potential threat to a well-functioning democracy. The United States government this week asked Australia to scrap the proposed laws, which have broad political support, and suggested Australia should pursue a voluntary code instead. Google's threat to limit its services in Australia came just hours after the internet giant reached a content-payment deal with some French news publishers. Google's testimony "is part of a pattern of threatening behaviour that is chilling for anyone who values our democracy," said Peter Lewis, director of the Australia Institute's Centre for Responsible Technology .

NEW DELHI: Jack Ma appeared for less than a minute and said nothing about the Chinese government clampdown that had left his business empire in crisis. But for investors whoâd been waiting months to catch a glimpse of Ma, the entrepreneurâs participation in a live-streamed video conference on Wednesday was enough to trigger a $58 billion sigh of relief. Thatâs how much Alibaba Group Holding Ltdâs market value soared after a clip him speaking to a group of teachers began circulating online -- his first public comments since disappearing from view late last year. Much about the future of Chinaâs most famous businessman remains unclear. Yet analysts said Wednesdayâs video was a sign that worst-case scenarios -- such as jail time for Ma or a government takeover of his companies â- are probably now off the table. Itâs unlikely Ma would have participated in the event without at least tacit approval from Beijing; state-run media including the Global Times were among outlets that posted snippets of his talk or wrote stories about his appearance. Alibaba's Jack Ma makes first public appearance since October last yearâThereâs still a lot of uncertainty on regulatorsâ next moves, but this does mean the status of Jack Ma is much better than a lot of people speculated,â said Fang Kecheng, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Maâs talk focused on philanthropic issues including the importance of narrowing income disparities and reviving Chinaâs countryside, two big priorities for Xi Jinpingâs Communist Party. While far from a mea culpa, the comments offered a stark contrast to Maâs last public remarks in October, when the billionaire launched into an unusually strong rebuke of Chinese regulators and state-owned banks. Just a few days after that now-infamous speech at the Bund Summit in Shanghai, the government torpedoed Maâs plan to take Ant Group Co. public in what would have been the worldâs biggest-ever initial share sale. In the weeks that followed, authorities called for an overhaul of Antâs business and began an antitrust probe of Alibaba. Few expect Maâs change of tone will cause Beijing to back off its campaign to more tightly regulate Ant, Alibaba and the rest of Chinaâs high-tech giants. But Wednesdayâs market response suggests investors are beginning to price out the risk of a crackdown that would put the countryâs richest entrepreneurs and most innovative companies in serious jeopardy. âAlibaba is not out of the doghouse, but at least itâs clear that the current anti-monopoly drive is not about punishing Jack Ma,â said Zhang Fushen, senior analyst at Shanghai PD Fortune Asset Management. Speculation about Maâs whereabouts had intensified in recent weeks after it emerged that he skipped the recent taping of a Shark Tank-like TV program that he had created. Chinese authorities have in the past quietly detained billionaires that run afoul of the Communist Party. Maâs resurfacing appeared to be carefully calibrated, according to Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. The video conference was part of an annual event Ma hosts to recognize rural teachers. A former English teacher himself, Ma spoke in a solemn tone about the need to create better education opportunities in Chinaâs poorer areas. âRecently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,â Ma said. âWorking hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.â It was âthe perfect setting for Jack to reappear in the public spotlight,â Tang said. âThe backdrop sees Jack in his roots as a humble school teacher versus being a haughty entrepreneur that doesnât know his place. The whole scene allows him to show contriteness without being scripted.â Ant, which is controlled by Ma and part-owned by Alibaba, confirmed the authenticity of the video but declined to comment further. Ant had suffered a âconsiderable shockâ after Beijing suspended its stock market listing, an event that was expected to value the company at over $300 billion, said James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, a significant investor in Alibaba. âItâs plain that there are less chances of it being extraordinarily profitable than there were before,â he told Bloomberg TV. It was âthe perfect setting for Jack to reappear in the public spotlight,â Tang said. âThe backdrop sees Jack in his roots as a humble school teacher versus being a haughty entrepreneur that doesnât know his place.

Ant had suffered a âconsiderable shockâ after Beijing suspended its stock market listing, an event that was expected to value the company at over $300 billion, said James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, a significant investor in Alibaba. âItâs plain that there are less chances of it being extraordinarily profitable than there were before,â he told Bloomberg TV. The big question facing investors now: to what degree will Beijing keep tightening the screws on Ant, Alibaba and its peers? The early evidence suggests regulators arenât in a hurry to let up. Just a few hours after Maâs reappearance, Chinaâs central bank released draft rules to curb market concentration in online payments, potentially dealing another blow to Ant and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. The move is part of a wide-ranging campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing views as wielding too much control over the worldâs second-largest economy. Despite the regulatory overhang, Alibaba bulls at firms including Amber Hill Capital Ltd and Pegasus Fund Managers Ltd said easing concerns over Maâs status might be enough to lift shares of the e-commerce company back toward its record high in October. That would imply a gain of about 15% in the Hong Kong-listed shares from their close on Wednesday. Alibaba slipped 2.2% at 9:31 am local time on Thursday. Mitchell Green, a founding partner of Lead Edge Capital who holds shares of Alibaba, expects Ma to focus primarily on charity work going forward, a shift that began a few years ago. Green said heâs still optimistic about the long-term prospects for both Alibaba and Ant. âBoth are very important to Chinaâs economy and its people,â he said.

NEW YORK: Wall Street greeted new US President Joe Biden by climbing even higher on Wednesday, closing at records amid promises of big economic stimulus and relief that the inauguration was uneventful. All three major indices ended at all-time highs after Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States in a peaceful ceremony just two weeks after supporters of former president Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the results of the November election. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index led the charge, jumping 2.0 per cent to end the day at 13,457.25, fueled in part by a huge gain Netflix shares following a strong earnings report. The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to close at 31,188.38, while the broad-based S&P 500 climbed 1.4 per cent to 3,851.85. Biden and his team have championed an aggressive economic relief package, winning kudos from investors eager to see the US economy rebound. "In general, this is a market that's growing optimistic that increased fiscal spending will boost the economy and lead to earnings growth," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. Investors were among those sighing in relief that worries over fresh civil unrest did not come to pass, as the transition of power took place in the nation's capital that looked more like a military stronghold. "We all hoped for a peaceful transition of power and we got it," Hogan said. Among individual companies, Netflix shot up 16.9 per cent after it reported better-than-expected subscriber growth in the past quarter. The streaming entertainment leader added some 8.5 million paid subscribers in the quarter to reach 203 million despite recent price hikes, its quarterly earning update showed. Other large technology companies also had a winning session, with Apple ending up 3.3 per cent, Amazon up 4.6 per cent, Google-parent Alphabet hitting a record high after gaining 5.6 per cent and Facebook rising 2.4 per cent.

NEW DELHI: Joe Bidenâs first year in office could go down in history as a record-breaker on the job-creation front, with an explosion in hiring expected as the coronavirus vaccine rollout allows Americans to emerge from a year in hiding. It may not be enough. Only slightly more than half of the 22 million jobs lost in the pandemic were regained by the end of last year. Even if 2021 hiring shatters the post-World War Two record of 4.27 million jobs created in 1984, roughly a quarter of those who lost work could still be on the sidelines, with bleak prospects for regaining their vocations in an economy reshaped by the pandemic. As Biden took the oath of office on Wednesday, the job market awaiting him presents a monumental challenge. Just a year ago, a record-long expansion was creating more opportunities and higher pay for women, minorities and other workers on the margins. These same groups - key to his election victory - were disproportionately harmed by pandemic job losses in service-sector jobs that face the longest road to recovery. âItâs not only about recouping what weâve lost, itâs recouping what could have been,â said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton. âYou need a lot of tail wind to get there.â Biden unveiled an ambitious $1.9 trillion plan last week for shoring up the economy by enhancing jobless benefits and providing more direct cash payments to households. A second phase of his plan is expected to boost job creation through investments in infrastructure, clean energy projects and education. It is unclear how many of his proposals will pass through Congress, but Democratsâ slim majority in the Senate may help. Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve Chair and Bidenâs nominee for Treasury Secretary, urged lawmakers on Tuesday to act aggressively. âWithout further action, we risk a longer, more painful recession now â and long-term scarring of the economy later,â Yellen said during her confirmation hearing. That fiscal support, if delivered, could be bolstered by another tailwind: Easy monetary policy from the Fed. Fed officials committed last year to a new framework that aims for âbroad-based and inclusiveâ employment. Under the new approach, policymakers will no longer raise interest rates preemptively when the labor market is heating up in anticipation of faster inflation. Instead, rates will stay low for longer, giving the economy more time to benefit disadvantaged workers. âTheyâre going to keep their foot on the accelerator even beyond the time when weâre at full employment,â said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moodyâs Analytics. Combine that with additional fiscal support, and you suddenly have âa lot of policy juice to the economy,â he said. Pain unevenly spreadIt took more than six years for the US labor market to recoup all of the jobs lost during the last recession. Policymakers are expecting the recovery to happen more quickly this time around with the help of effective vaccines. But as the post-pandemic jobs landscape takes shape, some workers may need extra help moving into different lines of work. Special attention may need to be paid to the 4 million Americans who have been out of work for more than six months, putting them at greater risk of facing pay cuts or dropping out of the labor force altogether. In their ranks: Many of the servers, cooks, bartenders and other leisure and hospitality workers left jobless by the shutdowns meant to curb the virus. âUnless we act now, weâre going to again leave behind millions of Americans,â said Senator Chris Van Hollen, one of several lawmakers who met virtually last week with Cecilia Rouse, Bidenâs nominee for chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to discuss programs that could help the long-term unemployed. The low-wage workers hit hardest by pandemic job losses - including women, Black and Hispanic workers - are also among those at greater risk of falling through the cracks as the economy heals. âEven though by next year the economy should be booming, it still is going to take quite a whileâ for Black and Latino workers to see labor market gains because they are more subject to discrimination, said William Spriggs, chief economist with the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of US labor unions. For instance, the unemployment rate for white workers dropped to 6% in December, below the overall unemployment rate of 6.7%. But Black and Hispanic workers faced higher jobless rates of 9.9% and 9.3%, respectively. Many women are also at risk of facing lasting scars after being disproportionately affected by shutdowns of schools and child care centers. Of the 3.9 million people who dropped out of the labor force between February and December, 55% were women. Bringing them back to work will require policies that make caring for children and other relatives more affordable, said Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist for the Rand Corporation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that he is hopeful the labor market may surpass pre-crisis levels soon. âWeâve got to get through this very difficult period,â he said on Thursday during a virtual event organized by Princeton University. âBut as the vaccines go out and we get Covid under control, thereâs a lot of reason to be optimistic about the US economy.â

NEW DELHI: The United States (US) welcomed its 46th President on Wednesday. In his very first acts, Joe Biden would look to undo the policies put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump. President Biden is all set to propose a modern and comprehensive immigration bill to Congress that is slated to stimulate the US economy while ensuring the protection of every worker. Known as the US Citizenship Act of 2021, the legislation proposes to eliminate per country cap for employment-based green cards -- a move that could largely benefit Indian IT professionals in the country. Here's how the bill proposes to work:* The bill proposes to create an earned path to citizenship for immigrant neighbors, colleagues, parishioners, community leaders, friends and loved ones. * It allows undocumented individuals to apply for temporary legal status in the country. These people will have the ability to apply for green cards after 5 years,if they pass criminal and national security background checks and pay their taxes. Only 7,990 Indian employees got green card in fiscal 2019* Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders and immigrant farmworkers who meet specific requirements are eligible for green cards immediately under the legislation. * All green card holders who pass additional background checks and demonstrate knowledge of English and US civics can apply to become citizens after three years. * The bill reforms the family-based immigration system by clearing backlogs, recapturing unused visas, eliminating lengthy wait times, and increasing per-country visa caps. Aged-out kids in US: Must opt for international student-visa or self deport* It prioritises keeping families together by eliminating the so-called '3 and 10-year bars' and other provisions. It also explicitly includes permanent partnerships and eliminates discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families. * The bill clears employment-based visa backlogs, recaptures unused visas, reduces lengthy wait times, and eliminates per-country visa caps. * It bill makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced degree in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to stay in US. * Further, it improves access to green cards for workers in lower-wage sectors; and eliminates other unnecessary hurdles for employment-based green cards. 86,000 odd Indian children will age out owing to the green card backlog, with a risk of family separation* Dependants of H-1B visa holders will be able to get work authorisation. Children will be prevented from aging out system. * The bill includes the No Ban Act that prohibits discrimination based on religion and limits presidential authority to issue future bans. It also increases diversity visa program from 55,000 visas to 80,000 per year. * It also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development, giving authority to the department of homeland securities (DHS) to adjust green cards based on macroeconomic conditions. * The bill also incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers.

NEW DELHI: The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit all-time highs on Wednesday as Joe Biden prepared to take charge as US President, while Netflix shares surged after saying it will no longer need to borrow billions of dollars to finance its TV shows and movies. Shares of the world's largest streaming service surged 14% to add more than $30 billion to its market capitalization, helping boost the broader tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Biden, due to take over as the 46th President of the United States just after noon (1700 GMT) on Wednesday, will waste little time turning the page on the Trump era, advisers said, signing a raft of 15 executive actions on issues ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to the economy to climate change. "It's all about the inauguration, focusing first on Biden being placed into the office and then it's going to be about earnings," said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut. The Dow has gained about 57% in the four years since Donald Trump assumed office on January 20, 2017, which compares with a 72% jump in the first term of the Obama administration. Bets on a bigger pandemic relief plan and higher infrastructure spending under the Biden administration, and a Democrat-controlled Congress have been pivotal in driving major US stock indexes to all-time peaks this month. Six of the 11 S&P sectors advanced in early trading, with technology, communication services and consumer discretionary among the biggest gainers. Wrapping up quarterly reports from major US lenders, Morgan Stanley climbed 0.8% after its quarterly profit blew past estimates as the its trading business benefited from coronavirus-induced volatility in financial markets. S&P 500 company earnings are expected to rise by 24% in 2021 after falling 15% in 2020, according to Refinitiv data. With stock market valuations sitting close to a 20-year high, investors are hoping corporate results and profit outlooks will help them determine to what degree the valuations are justified. At 10:12 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 164.52 points, or 0.53%, to 31,095.56, the S&P 500 gained 36.94 points, or 0.97%, to 3,835.85 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 219.91 points, or 1.68%, to 13,418.23. UnitedHealth Group Inc slid 0.7% after the health insurer's quarterly profit slumped nearly 38%, weighed down by costs related to its programs to make COVID-19 testing and treatment more accessible for its customers. Procter & Gamble Co raised its full-year sales forecast for a second time but its shares slipped about 0.7% as it warned that the pace of sales might slow as vaccines roll out. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.5-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.9-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 posted 45 new 52-week highs and no new lows while the Nasdaq recorded 382 new highs and six new lows.

NEW DELHI: US President-elect Joe Biden is set to issue several measures on Wednesday aimed at rolling back some of the restrictive immigration policies put in place by his predecessor President Donald Trump. Some reversals will be immediate while other policies will take much longer to unravel. Immigration reform and 'dreamers' Biden plans to immediately propose an immigration bill, officials told reporters on Tuesday. He will propose an eight-year pathway to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million people living in the country unlawfully. The proposal will also offer permanent protection for young migrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, known as "Dreamers." Started by former President Barack Obama, the program provides deportation protection and other benefits to approximately 645,000 people. The citizenship wait would be shorter - three years - for many DACA holders, farm workers, as well as recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which grants deportation protection and allows work permits to people from countries hit by natural disasters or armed conflict. Biden will also immediately issue a memorandum directing the department of homeland security and attorney general to "take all appropriate actions" to defend DACA from challenges. Trump's Republican administration tried to end DACA but was stymied in federal court. The program still faces a legal challenge in a Texas court. Travel and visa bansBiden will immediately rescind a controversial travel ban put in place by Trump, according to a factsheet shared with reporters. Trump banned travel from some Muslim-majority countries shortly after taking office in 2017. Following legal challenges, the US Supreme Court upheld a revised version of the ban in 2018. It has since been expanded to 13 nations. During the coronavirus pandemic Trump issued proclamations blocking the entry of many temporary foreign workers and applicants for green cards. While Biden has criticized the restrictions, he has not yet said whether he would immediately reverse them. Interior enforcement Biden will immediately repeal a Trump order to increase interior enforcement. The administration will leave it to the department of homeland security and other agencies to set enforcement policies "that best protect the American people and are in line with our values and priorities," according to the factsheet. Census counts Biden will immediately revoke Trump administration orders that sought to exclude noncitizens from being counted in the census and when US congressional voting districts are next redrawn, the factsheet said. Border wall Biden will immediately pause construction of the US-Mexico border wall and end an emergency declaration that helped authorize funding for it, according to the factsheet. Trump touted the wall as a major accomplishment during a Texas visit just days before leaving office. Biden's administration will review the legality of funding and contracting methods used for wall construction and determine how to redirect funding. Restoring asylum and refugees One Trump program called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in US immigration court. Biden said during the campaign he would end the program on day one. His transition team, however, has said dismantling MPP and restoring other asylum protections will take time. Under rules put in place by the US Centers for Disease Control during the coronavirus pandemic, most migrants arriving at the border are now immediately expelled. Biden's team has not pledged to reverse that policy right away. Migrant caravans have been on the move in Central America, with some aiming to arrive at the southwest border after Biden's inauguration. On Monday, baton-wielding Guatemalan soldiers clashed with migrants, removing a large part of a caravan that included women and children. Biden has also said he would raise the cap for refugees resettled in the United States from abroad to 125,000 from the historic low-level of 15,000 set by Trump this year.

BENGALURU: The newly formed Indian alliance, Atamnirbhar Digital India Foundation (ADIF), has written to the government, saying it should conduct a data audit of WhatsApp and its parent firm, the social media giant, on user data flowing outside India. ADIF was formed to fight BigTech firms like Facebook and Google. It is an internet body thatâs been set up by local entrepreneurs and investors to create a level playing field for Indian startups. It also aims to work with the government on regulatory and legal aspects of policy making in light of increased competition from major US firms. âGovernment may conduct an audit through CERT-In (government agency) to check any sharing of data of individual or business users with Facebook and its subsidiaries. Since WhatsApp proposes to share business interaction details of Indian customers with its group companies like Facebook, WhatsApp should be prohibited from offering any services which deal with personal sensitive data of Indian users,â the note sent to IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and reviewed by TOI, said. ADIF secretary general Ajay Data confirmed the same to TOI. Despite multiple clarifications from WhatsApp on its privacy policy changes, it continues to draw scrutiny from many quarters. ADIF has also highlighted that the government should ensure WhatsApp continues treating Indian users and businesses on a par with global markets even as the government has asked it to withdraw the proposed policy changes. âWhatsApp has rolled out separate privacy and data sharing policies for Europe and India wherein the protections offered to EU citizens are far greater than those offered to Indian users. In fact, WhatsApp does not share data of its European Union users with Facebook for the purpose of improving its products or advertisements. This raises questions as to WhatsAppâs intentions,â the note said.

BENGALURU: Salesforce has made its first investment in India. Its venture arm, Salesforce Ventures, which has backed firms like Zoom, has led a $15 million financing in HR-tech startup Darwinbox. The five-year-old startup helps organisations manage digitally their human resources needs, including hiring, on-boarding, touchless attendance, and employee management. The company has seen a three times jump in revenue in the last 12-15 months, Darwinbox co-founder Chaitanya Peddi said. The growth was aided by the pandemic induced demand for digital solutions. Salesforceâs backing will help the Hyderabad-based firm to expand in new markets. It will also tap into the expertise of the US cloud solutions major for building new products. Peddi will also work with Salesforce India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya to build partnerships and address market opportunities. Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed India, Endiya Partners, and 3one4 Capital have also participated in this round. The company has now raised a total of $35 million. âWhat would have taken three years, has taken three months (cloud adoption). Last quarter was our highest (by revenue and clients). We have added 300 clients in the last one year to take the total to 500,â Peddi said. In India, it works with a range of companies including Grofers, Myntra, Mahindra Group, TVS Group and Adani Group. It started expanding into South East Asia last year. âWe will focus on emerging markets - Middle East, Nigeria,â Peddi said. âCloud adoption in Asia is growing at a monumental pace and the pandemic has only further amplified the importance of going digital,â said Alex Kayyal, partner and head of international, Salesforce Ventures.

BERLIN: Human resources software company Personio said on Monday it had raised $125 million from investors at a valuation of $1.7 billion, becoming the second German technology startup to claim a 'unicorn' valuation already this year. Personio follows freight tech startup Sennder in achieving a valuation of more than $1 billion. The Munich-based company, which serves small- and mid-sized companies, last raised funds at a valuation of $500 million just 12 months ago. European software startups are drawing abundant backing from venture capital funds including Index Ventures, the lead investor in Personio's Series D funding round, despite broader business headwinds from the coronavirus pandemic. âWhile the past year has proven difficult for many industries and businesses, it has at the same time accelerated the digitization of small and mid-sized businesses," said Hanno Renner, Personio's co-founder and CEO. The company's all-in-one HR platform, which covers human resources, recruiting and payroll, is priced on a per-employee basis, making it possible for small companies to avoid up-front costs and to pay as they grow. Revenues doubled last year and Personio now serves 3,000 companies. In addition to its core German-speaking markets, the company has expanded into Spain, Britain, the Nordic region and Benelux and will enter France and Italy this year. Existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Northzone, Global Founders Capital and Picus participated in the funding round. Meritech invested in Personio for the first time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a Rs 1,000 crore seed fund for the start-up sector assuring there would be no shortage of funds for the sector and said the Centre will help them raise equity through guarantees. âThis will help in starting and growing new start-ups. Fund of funds scheme is already helping start-ups raise equity capital. India is working for a start-up ecosystem based on the mantra âOf the Youth, By the Youth, For the Youthâ, We have to fix our goals for the next five years and these goals should be that our start-ups, our unicorns should emerge as global giants and lead in the futuristic technologies,â Modi told the virtual Start-Up India International Summit. The PM also said future technologies and entrepreneurs should come together in Asia as it is also the century of Asia. He urged Asian countries to join hands, collaborate and take responsibility for leading this effort. Modi said the biggest USP of the start-up world is its disruption and diversification capacity. âThe greatest feature of this ecosystem is that it is guided more by passion than pragmatism. This âcan-doâ spirit is evident in the way India is working today,â he said. He cited the example of BHIM UPI which has revolutionised the payment system and in December last year, 4 lakh crore worth of transactions took place through UPI in the country. Similarly India is leading in solar and AI sector. The PM said the start-ups are changing the demographic characteristics of businesses. Citing data, he said that 44% recognised start-ups have women directors and number of women working in these start-ups is high. He said every state is supporting and incubating start-ups as per local possibilities and 80% of districts of the country are now part of the Start-Up India mission. Youth from all types of background are able to realise their potential in this ecosystem. The PM said this helped change mindsets and attitudes. âFrom âWhy donât you do a job? Why a start-up?â to âJob is alright, but why not create your own start-up!â. In 2014, only 4 Indian start-ups were in the âunicorn clubâ now, more than 30 start-ups have crossed the $1 billion mark,â he said.

BENGALURU: A group of Indian startups and investors have joined forces to form a new alliance -- Atmanirbhar Digital India Foundation (ADIF) -- to break the dominance of foreign internet giants like Google and Facebook. This body hopes to also advise the government and sector regulators on legal and policy frameworks needed to further grow the digital economy. ADIF's formation comes following the furore over Google's billing policy in India, which demanded a 30% share of in-app purchase amounts. While Google delayed the implementation of the policy in India, it led to local internet firms joining forces against the BigTech firms. The billing issue reached the government and competition regulator CCI opened a probe against the billing policy and its alleged partial treatment of its payments unit Google Pay. The probe is under way. ADIF has been set up as a Trust that will work for Indian companies for a level playing field and its members currently include venture firm India Quotient founding partner Anand Lunia, Murugavel Janakiraman of Matrimony, Ritesh Mallik, founder of Innov8 Coworking, Sairee Chahal of Sheroes, among others. Founders of large desi internet firms are expected to join the group, a member of the new alliance said. TOI had reported about this development in October last year. âThe idea is to get the process started. We will focus on Indian startups that are run by Indian founders. For example, a fully foriegn domiciled firm with no real Indian involved in decision making wonât be part of this. We are finalising these definitions. Member onboarding will start now and there will be elections to appoint formal positions in the Trust," one of the members said. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma is not yet part of the alliance, at least formally. During the Google billing controversy, Sharma was one of the fiercest critics. Just before that, Googleâs app store had taken down Paytm and its gaming app temporarily citing policy violations. This had kicked off a storm between the two companies. ADIF plans to open chapters in the top 25 cities over the coming few months and later expand membership further in smaller towns.

BENGALURU/MUMBAI: As the furore over changes in WhatsAppâs privacy policy grows, a wide range of companies have started mandating migration to messaging platform Signal. These include new-age tech startups, older corporates and their senior leadership teams who are now using Signal for day-to-day work chats and sharing of internal documents. Paytm and PhonePe, both of which are threatened by WhatsAppâs recent entry into payments, used the controversy to encourage their teams to shift out of WhatsApp. Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel & Power is moving out too.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called upon youngsters to attend 'Prarambh', the Startup India international summit on January 15 and 16, saying it seeks to bring together top minds from industry, academia, investment, banking and finance besides young start up leaders. He also shared his LinkedIn post in which he noted that virtual interactions have become the new normal during the Covid-19 pandemic and said a big advantage of this is that people can be a part of programmes sitting at home. "With most events being held virtually, it has given a great opportunity for youngsters to be a part of many interesting domestic & global forums. One such opportunity is coming up in the form of Prarambh on 15-16 Jan. I urge our youth to be a part of it," Modi tweeted on Monday.

"For me, it meant more programmes online, which were extremely productive and insightful. There were interactions with scientists, medical professionals, Covid warriors, academics, industry leaders, young innovators, spiritual leaders and more," Modi said. There were virtual summits, both bilaterals and multilaterals with world leaders, he noted, adding that "path-breaking" development schemes were launched through public events organised digitally. "I even interacted with lakhs of beneficiaries of existing government schemes," he said. Referring to the summit, the prime minister said India would also be marking five years since the the Start-Up India initiative began. "This initiative has propelled India to being among the most attractive start-up eco-systems globally," he said. "No words can do justice to the spirit of India's youth. Their penchant for innovation has led to outstanding results. Our start-up heroes are not merely coming from big cities but also from smaller towns. This is a good sign," he added.

WASHINGTON: India is currently the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion, India's top envoy in the US has said, as he expressed hope that more than 50 startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022. “Entrepreneurial activity has picked up in India. In 2020 India was among the top 50 innovative economies," India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said. "Today India is the third-largest, startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion. By some estimates, more than 50 ‘soonicorn' startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022,” he said. A unicorn is a term to indicate a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. Soonicorns are startup companies that are good candidates for late-stage investment and have a good possibility of becoming 'unicorns'. Sandhu was speaking at a mentoring programme for Indian National Startup Awards 2020 finalists that was co-hosted by the Embassy of India, in partnership with Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Monday. Sandhu said according to a recent report, Indian startups raised $9.3 billion until mid-December this year. “A little below 2019 but definitely encouraging, considering the current pandemic. It is because people like you were not averse to taking risks and were not deterred by challenges. People like you continued to think out of the box. People like you put all your efforts in creating a better life around you,” he said. Rise of Indian IT companies, large talent pool, increased expendable income of Indian middle class and availability of capital have contributed to the growth of India's startup ecosystem. More recently increased usage of smartphones, access to the internet, and recent reforms to push digital finance have given further impetus. There has also been a significant push from the Government through initiatives like Startup India and Digital India, he said. “Indian startups are steadily evolving into global entities creating business products, and solutions for the global market,” he added. “The Bay Area- Silicon Valley is the world's topmost innovation hub accounting for, I am told, more than a fifth of global venture capital investment. Its success has been hard to replicate elsewhere even with sizeable investments,” he said, adding that the important ingredient that is often found missing elsewhere is the culture of Silicon Valley. Three cities- Bengaluru, Mumbai and NCR Delhi- have changed the face of modern India and find a place among the famous Global Startup hubs. Cities like Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata are counted amongst the emerging startup hubs. “We need to do more to be counted amongst the ‘superstar hubs',” he said. Noting that India and Silicon Valley have a close relationship spanning over many decades, Sandhu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Silicon Valley in 2016 signified the importance of this entrepreneurial bridge and partnership. Sandhu said that Indian programmers, engineers and entrepreneurs are providing their skills and that too in sizeable numbers to US companies. India is also a leading R&D hub for many of these companies. Many US-based venture firms have been investing in Indian talent and are amongst the largest players in the field. Bay Area- Silicon Valley is also central to growth strategies of many Indian companies bringing innovation to the doorstep of customers with the help of startups, he said. “In the US, startup ecosystem is developing beyond Silicon Valley and big economic centres like New York, Boston, LA, Chicago. Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Research Triangle in North Carolina, Portland, Minneapolis, are gaining prominence, as emerging start-up hubs. This has opened up new opportunities for collaboration for Indian entrepreneurs,” Sandhu said. Around 150 Indian startups attended the event, said the Indian Embassy in a statement.

Commenting on the development, DFPCL Crop Nutrition Business President Mahesh Girdhar said: "The COVID-19 pandemic and low mobile data cost has accelerated the adoption of e-commerce platforms even in rural regions, and this trend is swiftly catching up in the agricultural space." Farmers now have access to diverse choices beyond the traditional services. Farmers will now have high-quality 'Mahadhan' products home-delivered, he added. âWe are excited to collaborate with Smartchem Technologies to enable broader and deeper penetration of their products across multiple states that we operate in," AgroStar CEO and co-founder Shardul Sheth said.

BENGALURU: Serial entrepreneur Kunal Shahâs two-year-old startup Cred has been valued at $806 million in a new round of funding of $81 million led by existing investor DST Global. DST Global has backed major internet startups like Swiggy, Ola, Udaan, Byjuâs and most recently Cars24. Cred, which offers rewards for credit card payments, has also exercised an employee share buyback programme worth over $1 million for its current and former staff, creating one of the fastest such staff share liquidity programmes. Credâs other existing investors like Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Tiger Global, and General Catalyst have also participated in this financing, which will be used to fuel growth. Shah said the company has managed to double its size during the pandemic and now has nearly 6 million members who use the platform to pay credit card bills. It focuses on a premium set of users. Applicants must have a minimum credit score of 750 to be a member. While it started as a credit card payments app, over the last six months it has launched new products that are said to be seeing strong traction. It has forayed into lending and rent payments. It also has Cred Pay, where merchants can sign up so users can pay them through Cred Pay. Some 1,400 merchants are on the platform. Shah said the majority of the new capital will be focused on user growth. âWe had a very clear strategy to delay monetisation and focus on user growth. We believe we are a perfect platform for merchants, and banking and financial services players to cross sell their products,â he said. On the employee share buyback, Shah said even at its current valuation, 10% of the company is allocated to the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). âWe hope to maintain this in the subsequent rounds of funding. The idea is to create a serious wealth creation opportunity for the team,â he said. Cred has seen credit card spends surpassing pre-Covid-19 level. This is also attributed to its users being affluent, people who have faced relatively less impact on their incomes due to the virus outbreak. âTheir consumption just shifted in different directions,â Shah said. Shah previously founded e-wallet Freecharge, which was sold to e-tailer Snapdeal for $400 million in 2015 in what was one of the largest M&As in the internet sector then.

NEW DELHI: Indian edtech startups received a total investment of $2.22 billion in 2020 as compared to $553 million in 2019, reflecting the confidence of investors in the segment that has seen a huge surge amid the pandemic, a report by IVCA-PGA Labs said on Thursday. The report, titled 'The Great 'Un-Lockdown': Indian EdTech', noted that Indian online education companies have raised USD 4 billion in the last five years (2016-2020) with companies like Byju's, Unacademy and Vedantu accounting for the highest share. In 2020, 92 players received funding, out of which 61 players received seed funding, the report by Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA) and PGA Labs, said. "Indian edtech startups received a total investment of USD 2.22 billion in 2020 alone, compared to $ 553 million in 2019. K-12 and Test Preparation companies accounted for the largest share ($1.98 billion), followed by Continued Learning ($142 million), Higher Education ($84 million), Pre-K ($12 million) and B2B Edtech companies ($ 7 million)," it said. The report highlighted that Byju's raised the most capital in the last five years at $2.32 billion (latest valuation at $12 billion), followed by Unacademy at $354 million (valuation at $2 billion). It estimates the education market in India to be worth $117 billion with about 360 million learners in FY20. Of this, about $49 billion is spent on school education and $42 billion on supplementary education (private coaching and test preparation). The education market is expected to grow 2x to $225 billion by FY25 at 14 per cent CAGR over FY20-25, it added. "EdTech is one sector which goes in sync with the Moore's Law, with the advancing tech, Education Technologies in India have become a change maker...EdTech in India has emerged a clear winner, this report also projects how new unicorns are being presented globally, putting India yet again on the globe in regards to tech, innovation and digital consumption," IVCA President Rajat Tandon said. Madhur Singhal, Practice Leader, Education, Employment and Entrepreneurship at Praxis Global Alliance, said large shifts in learner requirements is reshaping the education and EdTech landscape globally. "With an increase in focus on self-paced learning, an informed selection of tools/aids on top of better awareness and accessibility, and the idea of continuous learning beyond schools and colleges via professional education courses is driving innovations in the way learning content is being consumed and delivered in India," he added. Vaibhav Tamrakar, Vice President at PGA Labs, said digitisation of educational institutions and learning ecosystem, continuous learning for employability and professional career growth, and student-lifecycle services such as student housing and Fintech in education are some of the whitespaces where the next EdTech unicorn can emerge from India in the next decade. The report noted that the education sector has received growing attention from the government with budgetary allocation increasing from $11.3 billion in 2018-19 to $13.2 billion in 2020-21. Lockdown imposed due to the spread of Covid-19 has increased the demand for EdTech products in India manifold, it added. In response to the growing demand, EdTech players have scaled up their offerings and new players with innovative business models catering to unserved segments have emerged post-Covid-19, it said. Also, the recently introduced National Education Policy 2020 is expected to give a fillip to EdTech (both, in the classroom and outside the classroom) due to increased focus on concept-based learning for students, the report added.

NEW DELHI: A proper sherried malt is a beautiful thing to behold. Burgundy liquid brimming with the richness of over-ripened stone fruit, it balances aromatic intensity against structural nuance. While a seasoned whisky enthusiast might count one as the ultimate dram, savvy investors see it as an ideal asset. The Macallan 25âa bottle exhibiting all of the aforementioned attributesâretailed for $900 in 2013. Today, you wonât find it for under $2,000. Rare whisky has outperformed every other luxury asset, including fine wine, soaring some 564% in the last decade, according to the Knight Frank 2020 Wealth Report. Rising demand from Asian investors has led to marquee auctions â and even cyberattacks â regarding bottles that were expected to top $2 million. The Scotch whisky market isnât the only one susceptible to the surge. For the better part of the 21st century, the price of virtually all aged spirit has soared. As a result, even some wealth funds and indices comprising exclusively distilled liquid commodities promise average returns of 12% to 15% per annum. Ultimately, all the juice is meant to be enjoyed. Whether youâre just getting into the whiskey game or are a veteran collector, itâs becoming increasingly difficult to decide whether the latest limited release at your local bottle shop is worth sipping now or saving for later. The obvious answer is to do both. Sneaker heads refer to the behavior as buying âone to stock and one to rock.â For the boozehounds out there, I humbly offer: âStore it or pour it.â The exceptional liquids below constitute some of the highest quality liquids to hit the market over the past several years. They encompass a wide range of regionsâfrom unexpected bourbons to decades-old Scotch to new world Indian maltâa broad spectrum of spirit to create a collection with a story worth showing and with a value expected to keep growing. Prices listed are retail, although they can vary widely, especially for the more limited releases. Assuming you can only procure a single example of each, letâs take a look at whether or not itâs best to keep a cork in âemâfor now. Amrut Fusion Indian Single Malt ($70)This elegant bottling helped put Indian single malt on the map when it debuted in 2009. Today, it remains the gold standard of the style. The name derives from its production specs: a joining of Indian malt with peated malt from Scotland, forming a robust and smoky liquid that lingers on the palate well beyond each sip. Itâs great conversation piece on the back barâand an even better value, at under $75. Verdict: Pour it Town Branch Cask Strength Single Malt ($100)Although this distillery has been based in Lexington, Ky., since 2008, its giraffe-like copper pot stills came straight out of Scotland. The liquid held herein was among the first to hit the barrelâfreshly decanted Oloroso Sherry casksâwhere it slumbered for 11 years. What emerged is characterized by decadent notes of dates and dark chocolate. With only 3,000 bottles in circulation, itâs likely to see a surge in value in the years ahead. Verdict: Store it Waterford Single Farm Origin: Rathclogh Edition 1.1 Irish Whiskey ($100)Whisky giant Mark Reynierâthe man who helped revitalize Bruichladdich scotchâhas set sight on the Emerald Isle. His efforts have resulted in a super terroir-driven single malt that showcases the superiority of the barley at its core, with all grain grown and harvested from a singular farm. It arrives on US shores with this offering: an 100-proof butterscotch bomb. Itâs a joy to drink, sure. But the first edition in any intended series typically appreciates best, particularly when said series takes off, as Waterford is poised to do in the months ahead. Verdict: Store it Stranahanâs Mountain Angel 10 Year Old ($130)Exceptionally complex, with hints of sandalwood and caramelized sugar in alternating turns, this age-statement single malt out of Denver is also exceptionally elusive. An initial release consisted of just 500 bottles, available in New York, California, and Colorado. More should soon be coming, as this is intended to become a permanent brand extension. So if you do manage to track it down, itâs worth more to savor than save. Verdict: Pour It The Macallan Double Cask 18 Years Old ($330)Macallanâs Double Cask range features liquids that have been matured in both American and European oak, each previously seasoned with sherry. The lineup consists of a 12-year, a 15-year, and this elder statesman, which is the most sophisticated of the bunch. This 86-proof liquid drinks exceptionally easily, unfurling a smidge of sultana and ginger spice from its auburn body. Itâs also readily available as part of the brandâs core expressions. Verdict: Pour it Old Forester 150th Anniversary ($550)To celebrate its sesquicentennial birthday, this beloved Kentucky distillery unveiled three separate batches of limited-edition barrel-proof bourbonâeach with its own nuances and exceptional in its own right. Although they wonât be bottled again, thereâs no age statement here, which tends to temper investment potential. And since itâs such a joy to drink, it will do you far many more favors in the glass now than it ever will at some future affair. Verdict: Pour it Balblair 25 Year Old ($600)This Highland distillery has been overlooked by American drinkers for far too long. A recent rebranding looks to change that. Having formerly sold a series of vintage releases, itâs now pursuing the age-statement route, deploying sleek. stylish bottles to highlight the elegant, rounded liquid within. The most mature of the lineup is a medium-bodied malt aged for a quarter-century in ex-bourbon casks before finishing for several months in Spanish oak. Many of its scotch counterpartsâof comparable age and qualityâcurrently fetch more than double the cost cited here. Verdict: Store it Michterâs 25-Year ($1,000)When it comes to collectibility, few American producers can claim the credentials of Michterâs. The Kentucky whiskey makerâs special editions routinely climb five times above retail price within a year or so of initial release. This one is a prime example: a velvety melange of burnt sugar and winter spice. Itâs been three years since a barrel was last deemed spectacular enough to sell, so pounce if you find one of 348 new bottles anywhere near the $1,000 retail price; theyâre already seven times that on the secondary market. Verdict: Store it OFC 1995 Vintage ($2,500)Bourbon does not age the way scotch does. Because it rests in virgin cooperage and endures wide climactic shifts between seasons, the whiskey of Kentucky tends to be over-oaked by the time its Scottish cousin is just getting warmed up (around the 10-to-12-year mark). OFC exists as a stunning exception to this rule. Buffalo Traceâs little-known second luxury label makes Pappy Van Winkle seem like Bud Light. And although this bottle was laid down during Bill Clintonâs first term as US president, it remains entirely unimpeachable: tobacco, leather, and candied cherry on the palate, with a slight tinge of smoke tapering the finish. With such a high starting price, thereâs not much room to roar as an appreciating asset, so if youâre willing to lay down $2,500 on a bourbon at retail, chances are you can afford to enjoy it, too. Verdict: Pour it The Last Drop 1968 Glenrothes Single Malt ($6,000)Hereâs something you wonât readily find: an impeccably stewarded scotch malt holding a half-centuryâs worth of maturity. Bottled at a cask strength of 51.3% ABV, its noses evokes the fresh floral bloom of Scotland in spring. On the tongue hums marzipan, with the slightest intimation of toasted coconut along the edge. (Thatâs the least it should do, considering the price.) But hereâs the thing: This liquid is almost criminally undervalued. While it comes by way of an independent bottler who hunts down rare casks, the Speyside distillery from which it was sourced just released its own 50-year-old counterpart â¦ for $35,000! This one is essentially the exact same liquid for less than 1/6th the cost. Plus, the Last Drop mercifully accompanies all of its ultra-luxe releases with a 50 ml miniature. So you can pour and store. Everyone loves a happy ending. Verdict: Store It

MUMBAI: Registering a "very good" quarterly performance, Bajaj Auto on Thursday reported a 23 per cent jump in profit after tax at Rs 1,556 crore for the three months ended December 2020, on the back of higher volumes and exports. The company had posted a profit after tax of Rs 1,262 crore in corresponding quarter of the previous financial year, Bajaj Auto said in a statement. Its sales from operations during October-December 2020 rose 17 per cent to Rs 8,910 crore, compared with Rs 7,640 crore in the year-ago period. The firm sold a total of 13,06,810 vehicles during the third quarter of the current fiscal, a rise of 9 per cent as against 12,02,486 units a year ago, it said. "The third quarter of financial year 2020-21 has been a record quarter for the company with the highest-ever turnover which for the first time ever exceeded Rs 9,000 crore; the highest-ever profit before tax which for the first time crossed Rs 2,000 crore," Bajaj Auto Ltd said. Also, the company recorded an expansion in operating Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin to 19.8 per cent, driven by higher operating leverage and better product mix, it said in the release. Bajaj Auto chief financial officer Soumen Ray said the company clocked the highest-ever turnover despite the headwinds such as an uncertain domestic market, especially in the commercial vehicle segments, increasing costs and a shortage of containers for exports, especially the commercial vehicle segment. "It was a very good quarter with the highest-ever topline (revenue) as well as bottomline (profit)," he said. He said there was a lot of festive demand also during the quarter whether in India or some parts of the world. "We feel the domestic motorcycle (is) coming back to almost pre-COVID-19 level with a plus or minus two per cent growth. The domestic commercial vehicle industry, however, continues to be tough. We hope we should reach about 50 per cent of the normalised sales by the end of the March quarter," he said. The fourth quarter this fiscal will show significant growth over the year-ago same quarter, primarily because we had a base of transition from BS-IV to BS-VI and the impact on operations in the last 15-odd days of March 2020, he said. Exports continued to be on a roll with the highest-ever shipments in October and December, he said. There was some overflow of orders because of the unavailability of containers for exports, he added. Domestic two-wheeler sales grew eight per cent to 5,85,469 units, from 5,42,978 units a year ago. Commercial vehicle sales declined 65 per cent to 34,230 units, compared with 96,736 units, according to the release. Total domestic sales declined 3 per cent to 6,19,699 units, compared with 6,39,714 vehicles sold in the December 2020 quarter. The exports were over 6,87,000 units, the highest-ever, despite the shortage of containers, the company said. "On the demand part, (it is) reasonably decent but costs are a big concern. There has been a very steep rise in costs, primarily of steel and aluminium, which is a large part of our expenses. Also, the crude is hovering at around $55 per barrel. So, we will see some pressure on petroleum products as well," he said. Ray said that while the company has undertaken price revision in some markets from January, it will take up some more price revisions soon, as it is difficult to recover the whole cost increase in one quarter. Stating that the volumes are looking "reasonably decent", he said that in the premium segment, Dominar, KTM or Huisqvarna did very well. On the exports side, "in two-wheelers, we have certainly seen demand coming back barring Asean and Sri Lanka", Ray said. He said the joint venture with Triumph Motorcycles continues to be impacted because of travel restrictions. "But, work is going on, our R&D and their R&D are collaborating. We would like it to happen much faster but under the current circumstances, both sides are doing the best that can be done. " He said that while the Asean market is expected to come back to normal in another 3-6 months, the Sri Lankan market does not seem to be recovering soon because of the ban on non-essential imports till December 31, 2021.

NEW DELHI: Hero Moto, the countryâs top two-wheeler maker, crossed a record 100-million units in production, and is lining up an aggressive launch plan of 50 new products and upgrades over the next five years, chairman Pawan Munjal said on Thursday as the company works to strengthen its premium portfolio with new partner Harley-Davidson. Munjal said premium motorcycles and scooters will be a top focus area for the company which is expanding globally in markets in Latin and Central America, Africa and Asia. Hero, which had split from erstwhile partner Honda in 2011, is also focusing on electrics, where it is not only following an independent strategy but also through its investments in start-ups such as Ather. Munjal said that electrification in mobility is going to get stronger over the coming years, which opens up opportunities for companies such as Hero not only in India but even overseas. The corona pandemic had an impact on the Indian two-wheeler and larger automotive market in the middle of 2020, though the company said that demand has managed to come back to healthy levels now. Festive sales for the company had been strong last year, and it had sold a record 8 lakh-plus units in October, the highest in a single month for the company. âI am optimistic about 2021. As we look at it, motorcycle and scooter demand will only recover from here, and definitely improve. We are optimistic that the government and the upcoming budget will focus on the rural and agri sectors, which will benefit us.â Speaking about the partnership with Harley, Munjal said that the partnership with the iconic American bike major will help it strengthen its premium play. âThe partnership is aimed in that (premium) directionâ¦ We will design new products together, Hero will manufacture them, and then put the Harley badge.â As Harley quit solo operations in the Indian market, it decided to partner Hero for its India play, though the relationship does not involve any equity participation. Hero has been strengthening its premium portfolio with products such as XPulse200, Xtreme160R and Xtreme200S as it competes with rivals such as Bajaj and Yamaha in the category. Asked about expansion plans, Munjal said that the company will be ârevisiting investmentsâ, though refusing to give further details.

MUMBAI: Global consumer products giant Unilever has committed to ensure that everyone who directly provides goods and services to the company earns at least a living wage or income by 2030. While Unilever, which directly employs 1.5 lakh employees across 190 countries, already pays its employees a living wage, it wants to ensure the same for people beyond its workforce and across its value chain. Estimates suggest this could impact over a million people in 10 years, helping to reduce the social inequalities gap that is said to have only widened since Covid. A living wage allows people to afford a decent standard of living covering a familyâs basic needs â food, water, housing, education, healthcare, transportation, clothing as also a provision for unexpected events. A living wage is higher than the minimum wage as defined by various countries, cities or regions. Unilever is working with Fair Wage Network to arrive at a living wage standard across countries. In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Unileverâs chief HR officer Leena Nair said, âWhen we look around us and this is even more evident post-Covid, social inequality is a big issue. As a business that wants to be sustainable, we are announcing wide-ranging commitments and actions across three big areas â one, we want to raise living standards across our value chain, second is to create opportunities through inclusivity, and third is prepare people in the âFuture of Workâ.â Nair said the process will be audited and certified across the world. In India, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will support employees in the ecosystem, who are providing goods and services to the company, such as service providers, co-packers, carrying & forwarding agents (distribution network), and sales network. This would impact over 1.2 lakh people by 2030. The company will provide them with access to digital tools, financial inclusion and services, and publicâprivate models that support social entrepreneurship, to help them grow their business and their income. As more people rise to a living wage standard, it can have a direct benefit to the economy by spurring consumer spending. âItâs about creating a systemic change not just in Unilever, but across other businesses in various countries. We will work with our suppliers, other businesses, governments and NGOs â through purchasing practices, collaboration and advocacy â to create systemic change and global adoption of living wage practices,â said Nair. âThe hope is it will have a trickle effect and touch the lowest level in the value chain.â Before making this commitment, Nair said Unilever had to ensure that the same is provided for in terms of the business model. The 52-billion-euro Unilever â which is present in beauty & personal care, home care and food & refreshments â is also pioneering new employment models and equipping 10 million young people with essential skills to prepare them for job opportunities, by 2030. Pilots on new ways of working are being developed to offer security and flexibility. These include options such as flexible employment contracts with benefits such as pension plans, or offering time off work to study or re-train. Additionally, it also plans to help 5 million small and medium -sized enterprises in its retail value chain grow their business through access to skills, finance and technology, by 2025. Unilever has also committed to spend 2 billion euros annually with diverse suppliers, by 2025. HUL executive director (HR) Anuradha Razdan said, âIn India, we aim to positively impact women in the grassroots levels by hiring over 2,000 women in the shopfloor in factories. We are also working towards re-skilling and up-skilling over 12,000 blue-collar employees to make them future-fit.â Besides, using the strength of its brands, and its position as the second-largest advertiser in the world, Unilever plans to increase the number of advertisements that include people from diverse groups, both on screen and behind the camera. âBusinesses are seeing the need to lean in on this and to look after their most important asset, human capital. I have seen the mood and resonance to do something around people everywhere much more today as compared to say 5 years back,â said Nair.

NEW DELHI: State-owned Coal India Ltd on Saturday said that it is well geared to meet any surge in demand for coal from the power sector. The statement follows power demand touching an all-time high of 187.3 GW on Friday. "CIL (Coal India) is well geared to meet any surge in demand for the dry fuel from the power sector especially on the back of close to 63 million tonnes stock at its pitheads," the PSU said in a statement. The company is also pushing ahead for increased production, committed to shoring up the supplies to coal-fuelled power plants. In this backdrop, close to 67 per cent of the total coal-fired power generation in the country is fuelled through CIL's supplies. Of the 199 GW of coal-based power programmed for generation per day during the ongoing fiscal, 133 GW is scheduled from CIL linked coal. Average coal-based power generation of power per day which was 2.795 BU till Friday spurted up to 3.072 BU, a jump of nearly 10 per cent on the morning of the record making day. Coal-based power generation remains consistently high among all other categories. "This increase in coal-based power generation bodes well for us. If this continues, we could expect our supplies to power sector go up in near future," the company said adding that the power plants need to submit adequate programme at the coal companies to avoid any shortage of dry fuel as the demand started peaking. Coal India is focusing on ramping up its supplies to pithead based power plants to higher levels. This would influence in cost per unit of power generated coming down. Coal transportation cost to pithead power plants is comparably lower than long distanced based ones, making the landed cost of coal lower. This in turn makes the generation cost economical. Coal-based power generation accounted for 78.6 per cent of the country's total generation on Friday when all India peak power demand, which is the highest supply in a day, surged to a new record of 187.3 GW in the morning eclipsing the previous high of 185.82 GW recorded on January 20. Of the total 3.906 billion units (BU) generated on Friday, coal-fired generation chipped in the bulk with 3.072 BU.

NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel prices in the country on Saturday touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week. Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies. This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to Rs 92.28. Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.88 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed. This is the second consecutive day of rate increase and the fourth this week. In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week. Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts. Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out. State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Since then, rates have gone up by Rs 1.99 a litre on petrol and Rs 2.01 in case of diesel. This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India. Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later. This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far. Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

RBI sees V-shaped recovery: State of Indian economy explained in 10 charts

NEW DELHI: With domestic activity gradually returning to pre-Covid levels, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sees a phoenix-like recovery for the Indian economy. According to a recent report published by the central bank, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is not far from attaining positive growth. It observed that the economy will experience a V-shaped recovery in 2021, where V will stand for vaccine. India has already started one of the worldâs biggest vaccination drives against Covid-19. It plans to inoculate about 300 million people on priority by year end. RBI's report also stated that barring another wave of Covid, the worst is over for India. Hence, policymakers might soon have more room to support the recovery process. State of Indian economyThe Covid-19 pandemic has been a human and economic catastrophe for India. Almost one-fourth of the country's economic activity was wiped out due to fall in domestic demand in wake of the strict nationwide lockdowns to curb Covid infections. India's GDP dipped a historic 23.9 per cent in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020. The contraction narrowed down to 7.5 per cent in the second quarter (Q2).   However, so far India seems to have managed the Covid crisis pretty well. The first advance estimates of national income for 2020-21 released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) estimated real GDP growth in 2020-21 to be at (-) 7.7 per cent as against (-) 10.3 per cent projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 2020. In December 2020, RBIâs monetary policy committee (MPC) had projected GDP to be (-) 7.5 per cent.   Rise in government expenditureTotal expenditure of the government surged 48.3 per cent on year-on-year (y-o-y) basis in the month of November. While, capital expenditure shrugged off a three-month contraction and expanded 248.5 per cent. This was mainly due to the introduction of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package.   Revival of imports, exportsAfter contracting for 9 consecutive months, merchandise imports finally experienced a growth of 7.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December 2020. The revival was led by gold, electronic goods and vegetable oils. Rising imports of pearls and precious stones, machinery, electronic goods and textiles reflect the revival of domestic activity as they are of the nature of intermediate goods in supply chains. This also augurs well for exports going forward.   This suggests that moribund absorptive capacity of the economy is coming back to life, backed by domestic demand. Indiaâs merchandise exports have reached pre-Covid levels and exhibited a growth of 0.1 per cent in December 2020. Non-oil exports actually expanded by 5.6 per cent, marking the fourth consecutive month of positive growth. Financial markets surgeThe Covid-19 pandemic dragged the sensex to record low in late March 2020. But, it staged a strong recovery from the lows. Both the BSE and NSE indices finally wrapped up 2020 on a bullish note, with sensex gaining nearly 16 per cent. The BSE index jumped almost 91 per cent from its record low of 25,881 to breach the 50,000-mark in just over 10 months.   IPO marketDuring December 2020, the listing of two initial public offerings (IPOs), aggregating Rs 1,351 crore, took the total resource mobilisation through main board IPOs to Rs 15,971 crore during 2020-21 (up to December 2020), marking a sharp rebound from Rs 10,487 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Beginning with the first IPO issued in July 2020, healthcare and finance sector companies have garnered the maximum amount of resources among all initial offerings.   Industrial activity Although industrial output remains volatile, contracting by 1.9 per cent in November 2020 after a record expansion in October by 4.2 per cent, industrial activity is finally turning around. The headline purchasing managersâ index (PMI) manufacturing expanded in December 2020 to 56.4, a tick higher than Novemberâs reading of 56.3. Both new orders and output continued to grow strongly.   Record GST collectionsThe gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touched a record high of over Rs 1.15 lakh crore in December â the highest since the implementation of the regime. The collection indicates that the economy continues to show signs of recovery after a stringent lockdown last year. With this, the GST has also now crossed the psychological Rs 1 lakh crore-mark for the third straight month in the current fiscal.   Fall in government revenue Even though GST collections have been at record levels during the year, the pandemic has inflicted a âscissor effectâ on government revenues. On the one hand, it stretched expenditure on account of fiscal support to the economy that was completely unanticipated at the time of drawing up Budgets for 2020-21. On the other, there was contraction in revenues as activity went into complete standstill with lockdowns and other containment measures.   As a result, the general government gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 14.5 per cent in the first half of 2020-21.

NEW DELHI: A key job description of the central bank chiefâs profile is that he must take away the punch bowl when the party gets started or, in other words, prevent markets from getting overheated. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in the financial stability report recently attempted to do just that by warning of the growing disconnect between segments of the financial markets and the economy. The report also indicated that, in a severe stress scenario, bad loans of banks could double. Higher NPAs has a direct bearing on the sensex as over a third of the weightage comes from banks and finance companies and their earnings could take a hit if bad loans rise. But fund managers point out that while the 92% rise in indices from last yearâs 52-week low might seem too much and too fast, the equity gains are a much more modest 22% over January levels. Also the always market moves in fits and starts. For instance, between January 2010 and January 2020, the sensex just about doubled which meant a return of 7.4% which is measly when compared to the period between 2001 to 2008 when the sensex rose nearly 10 times. One of the key drivers of the recent rally has been the funds released by central banks globally. âCentral banks globally have eased liquidity to support their economies in the wake of Covid resulting in bonds worth trillions of dollars yielding a negative return. The rally in equity markets is not driven by growth in earnings but by an expansion in the PE, which is an outcome of global liquidity expansion,â said Saibal Ghosh, CIO of Aegon Life Insurance. What this means is that companies do not need to earn more for their stocks to become more valuable. Increasing liquidity and making fixed income instruments less attractive can also drive up stock valuation. âWhile one should rightly argue that the current upswing is a consequence of global event and policy lead, it is a reflection of an underlying restructuring that has been happening with the corporate sector, and the policy framework, which is now bearing fruit,â said a note by Edelweiss. According to Edelweiss, the beginning of the pandemic had coincided with the end of the corporate restructuring cycle. âIt had been slower than expected, but it was closer to the end. We believe the pandemic has precipitated this clean up and has set the business cycle for what could be a longer & cleaner upswing and more entrenched than a mere response to the pandemic,â the note added.

MUMBAI: Forecasting a V-shaped recovery, Reserve Bank of India has said that if growth momentum continues and inflation stays benign there would be room for policy action to support growth. This observation comes in the central bankâs State of the Economy report released on Thursday. This comes at a time when the central bank has started 'normalisingâ the liquidity in the money markets by draining out the surplus it had pumped in to stave off an economic crisis in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. âRecent shifts in the macroeconomic landscape have brightened the outlook, with GDP in striking distance of attaining positive territory and inflation easing closer to the target. If these movements sustain, policy space could open up to further support the recovery,â RBI said in the report.   Stating that the worst of the Covid-19 crisis is now behind RBI quoting William Shakespeare wrote: âRecent high-frequency indicators suggest that the recovery is getting stronger in its traction and soon the winter of our discontent will be made glorious summer,â. The report states that consumer confidence is expected to improve from January 2021, peak in July 2021 and continue till September ahead of the next festival season âGoing forward, two positive features are going to shape up the fiscal landscape in H2. First, the general government gross fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is likely to moderate to 10.4%. This development will be revenue-driven as the war effort of H2 bears fruit and receipts return to positive territory. Second, the quality of the fiscal deficit is also likely to be better in H2,â the report said. The RBI also sees a revival in non-oil exports due to rise in shipments of drugs and pharmaceuticals, agricultural items and iron ore. âIndia is already manufacturing 60 per cent of the vaccines sold globally. Furthermore, the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme introduced for bulk drugs and medical devices has received a positive response and is expected to support pharmaceutical and medical exports going forward,â RBI said.

BENGALURU: Launches and sales of residential projects almost halved in Bengaluru in the second half of last year compared to the year before, a report from Knight Frank showed, but sequentially the fall was much less suggesting that the worst shock from the pandemic is perhaps behind the sector. Launches dipped to 9,123 units from 12,878 while sales dropped to 11,402 units from 19.851. It was 10,806 and 12,177 units respectively in the first half of the year. "While the pandemic and associated lockdown disturbances have left an impression on 2020 performance of Bengaluru residential market, the city made a meaningful return in Q4 with a 32% QoQ improvement in home sales,â Shantanu Mazumder, senior branch director of Knight Frank in Bengaluru, said. The fourth quarter saw an improvement in sales performance compared to the previous 4-5 months with sales up 32% sequentially. Residential sales have reached 54 % of the pre-COVID level. Due to the pandemic, consumers now want to own bigger and better houses. With consumer preference shifting towards ready to move houses, developers have restrained new project launches in this year and reoriented operational and financial bandwidth towards completion of ongoing projects. The recurring spate of sales compared to launches have affected a gradual decline in the inventory level in the city. On an annual basis, unsold inventory is down 5% to 74,764 housing units as at end of 2020. South Bengaluru saw the highest quantum of homes sold in H2 2020 of 3,860 units followed by east with 3,750 units. South Bengaluru also registered maximum home launches to 3,740 units during the period.

NEW DELHI: As the Indian real estate sector recovered from the lockdown lows during the second half of 2020, the average price of residential properties increased by one per cent during October-December 2020, according to the Magicbricks' latest PropIndex. It showed that while the prices for the much in demand ready-to-move segment remained stable during Q4 of 2020, the under-construction segment prices rose by two per cent, amid the recovery phase. The increase in under construction prices was primarily led by western and southern regions. At the city level, the western region witnessed the most price increments, as prices in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Ahmedabad rose by one per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, while remaining stable in Pune. In the South, while Bengaluru remained almost stable, Hyderabad and Chennai witnessed quarterly price increments even though YoY price change was still negative by 1-3 per cent. Prices in the Delhi-NCR remained flat in Q42020, with a slight decline in the core markets of Noida and Gurugram. However, it has shown an improvement in affordable locations like Noida Extension, New Gurugram, and Sohna. The property search volumes remained at elevated levels in Q4 2020 at about 30 per cent higher than pre-Covid levels, after touching more than the 50 per cent hike in Q3 2020, as buyers continued to make a beeline because of Covid-led availability of distress deals and festive season discounts. On the supply front, Magicbricks witnessed more than a 25 per cent increase in property listings in Q4, post falling by 10 per cent in Q3 due to improvement in new launches and secondary market listings. Commenting on the PropIndex report, Sudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks, said: "With uncertainties around the economy and jobs now stabilising, we are witnessing signs of growth in the real estate sector as well. The economy has also stopped shrinking since October 2020 and now we are seeing a V-shaped recovery in the real estate sector." With impetus from the government in the form of stamp duty cuts in some states and first-home buyer incentives, buyer demand is expected to stay at elevated levels in 2021, he said.

NEW DELHI: Increasing R&D investment to expand technology development capabilities and leveraging Indian IT industry's prowess to serve requirements of Indian and global telecom players can help in moving towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), Trai chairman PD Vaghela said on Tuesday. Speaking at the 15th India Digital Summit, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman PD Vaghela outlined some of the steps that can be taken to make "speedy progress and to make India self reliant" in the telecom space. "We need to increase investment in research and development (R&D), this is very important...To be self reliant in the technology space, which is critical for economic and statistical perspective, we need to transform from consumer to producer of technology," he said. To upgrade and expand technology development capabilities, investments need to be made in the complete ecosystem, including research, innovation, standardisation, product development, testing and certification, he added. This requires a complete overhaul of the existing practices and policies and industry-academia linkages need to be established, he said. "The commercial research innovations standardisation and product development need to be incentivised. Such innovation can also focus on meeting developing countries' requirement in the most effective manner and this will open vast market for such products for India," he added. Vaghela said India's IT industry capability can be leveraged to build, operate and maintain software products that can serve Indian as well as global telecom industry, at a reasonable price. "We all know that the maximum value addition is in the technology development, designing of products and services over the life cycle. Keeping in view India's strength in these areas, global companies have already started to establish their R&D centres in India. India has potential to be a global leader in telecom software development and servicing space," he added. Government and regulators can play a major role in encouraging digital innovation and incentivising the development of digital technology for the benefit of society, he noted. Vaghela said there is a need to push indigenous telecom products in India amid the booming growth in mobile and fixedline broadband as well as rise of Industry 4.0 and digital automation. "India has launched a series of market reforms in the last few years that form the foundation for enhancing India's appeal as a manufacturing base. With the skill base in India that includes telecommunication also and the scale of domestic market and technology orientation, India presents an attractive option for global manufacturers," he added. Highlighting the growing consumption of data, Vaghela said the role of data centres attains equal importance towards becoming self reliant in the digital space. "...While India has taken a major leap in the digital space during the last six seven years, a lot is required to be achieved. And we all have to work together. This is one area where we can become self reliant very fast if the government, industry and academia come together and come out with solutions to the some of the challenges, which we are facing," he added.

NEW DELHI: Telecom firms like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Tuesday participated in pre-bid conference for spectrum auctions, as the telecom department asked telcos to submit written queries regarding the rules and processes by January 15, according to sources. During the pre-bid conference, operators raised queries on aspects such as earnest money deposit and roll-out obligations in the bid document, an industry source said. The department of telecom (DoT) sources said telcos, including Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea, attended the pre-bid conference on Tuesday. The department has now asked the operators to send their written queries on the issues raised at the pre-bid conference by January 15. The DoT has already released a notice inviting applications for the spectrum auctions in seven bands -- 700, 800, 900, 1,800, 2,100, 2,300 and 2,500MHz bands, and the bidding is scheduled to begin on March 1. Last month, the Union Cabinet had approved a proposal for the auction of 2,251.25 Megahertz (MHz) of spectrum worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore at the base price. Telecom operators will need to submit their application by February 5 for participation in the auction. BNP Paribas, last week, had said that spectrum auction in India has turned into a buyer's market, and may see "minimal competition" with operators going after airwaves that yield the best value for money instead of focusing on renewing all expiring spectrum. With the countdown now on for spectrum auctions, ICICI Securities had said it expects the final prices across spectrums to be equal to the reserve prices due to significant supply of radiowaves, and likely limited demand for expiring radiowaves.

NEW DELHI: State-owned telcos BSNL and MTNL turned EBITDA positive in the first half of 2020-21, demonstrating a marked improvement in performance within a year of approval of their revival plan, the communications ministry said on Monday. While EBITDA of Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) rose to Rs 602 crore during the first half of 2020-2021, that of MTNL stood at Rs 276 crore, it said in a release. Both organisations expect to reduce their losses by 50% when compared to 2019-20, it said. Regarding 4G services, the department of telecom (DoT) has made its position clear that core network for 4G will be “totally made in India”. BSNL and MTNL are strategic assets, and will provide a big impetus to Indian manufacturers in the field of telecom. BSNL is once again back on the track of profitability, it added. The improvement in performance came on the back of a sharp reduction in wage bill due to Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).

NEW DELHI: BSNL Employees Union has urged the company's chairman and managing director (CMD) to hold regular interactions with the unions, like his predecessor did, for early revival of the loss-making public sector firm. BSNL CMD PK Purwar, however, said he keeps meeting unions, employees and even individual employee for their suggestions and advice. In a letter to Purwar, seen by PTI, the union said in mid-2016, BSNL management, under the then CMD Anupam Shrivastava showed inclination to involve unions and associations in the management's initiatives "night free calling" and "all India free roaming" where employees went beyond their duty hours to popularise the schemes resulting in increase in company's subscriber base. BSNL is the only company, apart from Jio, that has regularly gained mobile customers. The subscriber market share of BSNL increased to 10.35 per cent in March 2020 from 9.44 per cent in March 2018. The company now has over 11.8 crore mobile customers. BSNL employees Union (BSNL EU) general secretary P Abhimanyu in a letter dated January 7 said unions and associations utilised inputs from the management around various initiatives for motivating the employees to give better performance. "When AUAB (Unions and Associations of BSNL) decided to organise the "Service with A smile" movement, the then CMD BSNL, Anupam Shrivastava ji, was kind enough to get that movement kickstarted through a huge meeting held in the corporate office premises. "However, we regret to say that the coordination between the management on one side and the unions and associations on the other side, has become a story of the past," BSNL EU said. When contacted, Purwar said "I always meet both unions and associations as well as individual employees to seek their valuable suggestions, support and advice." BSNL EU on the other hand said it has insisted BSNL CMD on many occasions and alleged that he has been reluctant to have regular interactions with unions and associations as was done in the past. "Even during this Covid-19 pandemic situation, interactions could have very well been organised with the unions and associations, through video conferencing. Unfortunately, that has not happened. Perhaps, you are under the impression that the unions and associations are there only to raise demands of the employees," the letter said. It added that the management's mindset of viewing the unions and associations "as a headache" should be shed. "We urge upon you to restart the practice of having regular interactions with the unions and associations for the sake of involving employees for the early revival of the company," BSNL EU said. BSNL recorded a loss of Rs 15,500 crore and debt of Rs 21,902 crore in August 2020.

NEW DELHI: Bidding for the sixth round of spectrum auction for radiowaves worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore will start from March 1, according to a notice issued by the department of telecom on Wednesday. The long-awaited spectrum auction is being held after a gap of four years and over two years after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) calculated and recommended base price for the radiowaves. The DoT has fixed January 12 for the pre-bid conference and January 28 as the last date for seeking clarification to the notice. Telecom operators will need to submit their application by February 5 for participation in the auction. The final list of the bidders will be declared on February 24 and the auction process is scheduled to begin from March 1. The Union Cabinet had approved the proposal to auction 2,251.25 Megahertz (MHz) of spectrum worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore on December 17, 2020, in seven frequency bands - 700 Mhz, 800 Mhz, 900 Mhz, 2100 Mhz, 2300 Mhz and 2500 Mhz - at the base price recommended by the Trai. The government has kept the frequency bands of 3,300-3,600 MHz band that industry identifies for rolling out 5G services out of the upcoming auction. These frequencies were part of Trai recommendations for the auction. Bidders opting for 700 Mhz band will have to shell out at least Rs 32,905 crore on pan India basis for the frequencies in the premium spectrum band. The signals transmitted in the 700 Mhz band are considered to cover three times compared to 2100 Mhz band -- popularly known as 3G band. The DoT has made available spectrum in all the 22 telecom circles across the country for 700 Mhz band, 800 Mhz band and 2300 Mhz band, while radiowaves in 1800 Mhz band are available in 21 circles, 900 Mhz band and 2100 Mhz bands in 19 circles each and 2500 Mhz in 12 circles only. Successful bidders opting for full upfront payment will need to do so within 10 days of declaration of the result. In case of deferred payment option, successful bidders will need to make an upfront payment of 50 per cent in the case of 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, and 2500 MHz bands, and 25 per cent in case of 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands of the final bid amount should be made within ten calendar days from the date DoT issues demand notice. There will be a moratorium of two years for payment of the balance amount of one-time charges for the spectrum, which will be recovered in 16 equal annual instalments. In addition to the bid amount, successful bidders will also have to pay three per cent of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR), excluding wireline services, as spectrum usage charges for the spectrum won through this auction. Market analysts believe the upcoming spectrum auction will get bids in the range of Rs 30,000-Rs 50,000 crore. According to market experts, telecom operators are likely to focus on the renewal of spectrum, and Vodafone Idea may not participate in the auction for renewal of their spectrum in some circles. Rating agency Icra said it does not foresee any major participation in the 700 MHz band and pegged the bids to be in the range of Rs 55,000-60,000 crore. JM Financials, on the other hand, expects bids to be in the range of Rs 30,000 crore only. Bharti Airtel's 12.4 MHz of spectrum in the 900 MHz band and 47 MHz in 1800 MHz band and Reliance Communications' 44 MHz of spectrum in the 800 MHz band being used by Reliance Jio are coming up for the renewal. Vodafone Idea needs to renew 6.2 MHz of spectrum in the 900 MHz band and 38.2 MHz in the 1800 MHz band. According to Credit Suisse, renewal of these spectrum frequencies will cost around Rs 15,000 crore to Bharti Airtel and Rs 11,500 crore to Reliance Jio.

MUMBAI: The pandemic has caused major change of priorities for urban Indians as far as their savings are concerned. People are saving less for marriages, kidsâ education or for small luxuries like cars and vacations. They are setting aside more for retirement, health and untimely death of the breadwinner. According to an annual survey conducted by Max Life, the awareness and actual purchase of insurance by households has jumped during the last one year. But there is a general feeling of being less secure than before, thanks to the fallout of the pandemic. âThe overall protection quotient has gone up as Indians are more aware of insurance protection. Life insurance ownership has gone up 5 percentage points to 71% (among respondents), but the percentage of respondents feeling secure has come down from 60% to 57%,â said Max Life Insurance CEO Prashant Tripathy. He added that this lower level of security was after a vaccine being available, but was understandable given the pain and hardship caused by the pandemic. The survey brought out that insecurity is higher among millennials as compared to non-millennials. According to Tripathy, this was because they were not as settled in their careers as older people. Besides buying more term insurance than last year, the number of respondents having a critical illness cover doubled too. One of the key findings of the survey is that the self-employed have for the first time overtaken salaried in ownership of term insurance. As against last year when 28% salaried and 26% self-employed owned health covers, this year the ratio was 24% and 31% respectively. Going by geography, North India recorded the highest drop in level of feeling of security. As against 68% respondents who felt secure last year, this year it was only 61%. The West actually saw the feeling of security marginally improve from 53% to 54%.

It is tough times in life that teaches us the most valuable lessons. The same can be said true of investments âCOVID-19 pandemic taught us the importance of having a fixed income portfolio with high quality instruments as part of oneâs core allocation.When it comes to investing in debt mutual funds, people find it difficult to understand the pros and cons of different strategies being offered. Past performance or high yield to maturity (YTMs) are not the ideal ways of selecting and allocating to debt mutual funds. Choosing the right fund should be basis investorâs risk appetite and investment horizon. There is a simple yet effective framework that helps segregate debt mutual funds into different buckets, thereby making it easier for investor to choose. This framework comprises of three distinct buckets: liquidity, core and satellite.Liquidity: This bucket is for very short term parking of surplus or for emergency corpusCore: This bucket ideally should form bulk of investorâs allocation â Funds that focus on high credit quality and low to moderate maturity profileSatellite: This bucket has funds that can take higher risk â either duration risk or credit risk or bothBy following this simple method and focusing on building your core allocation first, we believe that the risk in fixed income investing can be mitigated significantly.An offering in the fixed income space that fits in the Core bucket is IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan. It is an open ended short term debt scheme investing in instruments such that the Macaulay duration of the portfolio is between 1 year and 3 years. The portfolio is mostly a mix of high quality debt and money market instruments. As part of the current strategy, the average portfolio maturity is ordinarily anchored around 2 years.Here is the latest highlight of IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan:Data as on 31st December 2020:Average Maturity: 2.13 yearsModified Duration: 1.86 yearsMacaulay Duration: 1.94 yearsYTM: 4.39%Asset Quality: 100% AAA and equivalent instruments(AAA equivalents include sovereign, money market instruments, and cash and cash equivalents)We believe that IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan is a suitable investment option in these uncertain times given its focus on stability, liquidity and return potential of a high quality portfolio. The fund maintains a constraint on duration risk stance with its average maturity anchored around 2 years currently. The fund also has a constrained credit risk stance with its preference towards high quality instruments. The fund therefore can be an ideal fit in an investorâs core debt allocation and should be looked at for investment with a minimum horizon of 2 years.Disclaimer:MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET RISKS, READ ALL SCHEME RELATED DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY.The Disclosures of opinions/in house views/strategy incorporated herein is provided solely to enhance the transparency about the investment strategy / theme of the Scheme and should not be treated as endorsement of the views / opinions or as an investment advice.

MUMBAI: The Gujarat high court declined to interfere and issue a âwrit of mandamusâ to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for further extending the time limits to file the tax audit report and the Income-tax (I-T) returns up to March 31. The All Gujarat Federation of Tax Consultants had filed a writ petition with the high court seeking extension of the filing due dates for the financial year ended March 31, 2020. Ordering extension of the due dates may upset the entire functioning of the government and may lead to undesirable results, the high court stated. However, it added that the CBDT may consider issuing an appropriate circular taking a lenient view as regards the consequences of late filing of tax audit report â relating to penalties prescribed under section 271B of the I-T Act. Consequent to filing of the writ petition, the high court asked the CBDT to look into the matter. Following this, CBDT issued a detailed order on January 11 and stated that in the backdrop of the pandemic, the government had been considerate and had extended the due dates from time to time. For instance, the due date for filing the I-T returns for non-audit cases was extended thrice from the original due date of July 31, 2020 to January 10, 2021. For taxpayers who are required to get their accounts audited, the due date was extended from October 31, 2020 to now stand at February 15, 2021. Tax audit reports could now be filed by January 15, 2021 as opposed to the original due date of August 30, 2020. Backed by statistics, the CBDT also submitted that the number of returns filed for the FY 2019-20 (5.95 crore as of Jan 10) already exceeded those filed in the previous year by around 6%. The counsel for the Federation argued that ââ¦The CBDT had very conveniently and consciously not addressed itself to the hard reality that the utilities for E-filing the tax audit reports and I-T returns were released at a belated stage.â For instance, substantive amendments were made in the form of the tax audit reports on October 1 and the utilities were released only on October 22. This had created a complete state of disarray. Even if the two subsequent extensions are taken into consideration, then the total time available is only 85 days instead of 183 days, the counsel pointed out. However, the high court held that CBDT must have taken its decision not to extend the dates further, after due deliberations. Ordering an extension of the due dates may upset the entire functioning of the government and may lead to undesirable results, the high court stated. However, it added that the CBDT may consider issuing an appropriate circular taking a lenient view as regards the consequences of late filing of a tax audit report â relating to penalties prescribed under section 271B of the I-T Act.

NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has launched an automated dedicated online portal to receive and process complaints of tax evasion, foreign undisclosed assets as well as complaints regarding benami properties, said CBDT. The step has been taken towards e-governance and encouraging participation of citizen as stakeholders in curbing tax evasion, according to an official press release. The public can now file a Tax Evasion Petition through a link on the e-filing website of the department (https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/) under the head "File complaint of tax evasion/undisclosed foreign asset/ Benami property". The facility allows for the filing of complaints by persons who are existing PAN/Aadhaar holders as well as for persons having no PAN /Aadhaar.

NEW DELHI: Passengers travelling to the Netherlands are now required to undergo a Covid test within four hours of their flight departure time at the origin. This is in addition to the existing requirement of getting the RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of arrival time in Holland. A negative result from the new 4-hour pre-departure test will be needed to board flights to Netherlands. The rule is effective immediately and is the latest in the tightening of testing norms by various countries after the emergence of new and more infectious strains of Coronavirus. "Cost of the (new 4-hour) test will be borne by passengers. They are requested to arrive at the airport 5-6 hours prior as check-in will be permitted only after obtaining the test result," KLM said in a travel advisory issued Saturday. Holland's four-hour is the shortest pre-departure testing time that ranges from 96 to 48 hours for other countries. "The latest advisory by the government of the Netherlands requires all passengers arriving in the Netherlands effective January 23, 2021, to undergo a rapid antigen test within 4 hours prior to departure," KLM India tweeted on Saturday. India has an air bubble arrangement with the Netherlands and France and Air France-KLM operate flights under that along with Air India. From India, KLM says it "has made arrangements with the labs at the airport. KLM globally has made network adjustments, at the moment India operations are as scheduled." The four-hour pre-departure test is mandatory for all passengers going to Amsterdam, including transit flyers. "This (4-hour) test is in addition to the existing mandatory RT-PCR test (maximum 72 hours prior arrival in Netherlands) regulations and test requirements. For departures ex India, KLM has made arrangements with the laboratories at the airport for the administration of the required antigen test" a travel advisory by KLM says. These arrangements have been made at airports of Indian cities to which KLM currently operate like Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Due to the fast evolving nature of countries' responses to the Covid outbreak, all passengers are personally responsible to ascertain eligibility based on entry requirements for transit and destination countries, it adds. An increasing number of countries are tightening their Covid norms after the new and more infectious strains began to emerge. Lufthansa Group will require all passengers and crew to wear medical protective category â and not everyday use â masks from February 1. The new rule, applicable on all Lufthansa Group airlines on flights to and from Germany. Lufthansa operates flights to and from India under an air bubble arrangement. From February 1, âpassengers will be required to wear either a surgical mask or an FFP2 mask or mask with the KN95/N95 standard during boarding, the flight and when leaving the aircraft. Everyday masks are then no longer permitted,â Lufthansa said in a statement on Friday. UK and US have asked passengers flying there to test negative for Covid before being allowed on flights headed there.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu has barred UAE's flydubai from flying in passengers to the state till the month-end after the budget carrier brought a Covid positive passenger to Chennai this Sunday (January 17). The state government has also written to the Union aviation ministry to examine how this happened in violation of Tamil Nadu's entry norms for those flying in from abroad, said senior officials. This is perhaps the first instance of an Indian state barring a foreign airline from flying in people for violating its Covid rules. Indian carriers have been barred a few times during the pandemic for varying periods of time by Hong Kong and UAE for inadvertently flying Covid positive passengers there. Saudi Arabia allows Indian carriers to only fly out people from there to India and not to the Kingdom. UAE requires people flying in from several countries including India to undergo a Covid test 96 hours before their flight departure time and only those with negative reports are allowed to board flights for there. Chennai has a similar rule. Additionally, there is testing on arrival in Dubai for those coming from India and many other countries. "This person got a Covid test done from a certified lab in Chennai last Friday (Jan 15) and tested negative. He then travelled flydubai to Dubai. His on-arrival testing in Dubai gave a positive report," said sources. The passenger was then asked to quarantine himself as per rules, with the positive report uploaded on the app travellers to Dubai need to install on their smartphones. "On January 17, this person went to Dubai Airport and showed his two day old negative report for being allowed to board a flydubai flight to Chennai. Since the report was from a test done within 96 hours before departure for Chennai, he was allowed to board the flight as per rules of Tamil Nadu," said sources. On arrival in Chennai this passenger reportedly cleared both immigration and health checks by showing his negative report. "He was stopped at customs for baggage checks. To avoid the same, the passenger said he is Covid positive and showed his report from the test done on arrival in Dubai which was in his phone app. That is how it was known he was actually infected with the virus," said sources. The state government then barred flydubai from flying in passengers to Chennai from January 21 to 31, 2021, and has asked the Centre to examine this lapse. Aviation authorities are seeking clarification from flydubai, said an official. The airline is yet to decide if it will operate flights to only fly out people from Chennai to Dubai in this period. It cancelled the Chennai flight on Friday. Comments have been sought from flydubai and are awaited. It operates about 100 weekly flights between Dubai and 10 Indian cities including all the metros. During the pandemic there have been several instances of airlines allowing boarding of passengers based on negative test reports and then those flyers testing positive on arrival during random or mandatory tests. "We go as per rules and require passengers to show test reports as per the destination's entry requirement. With tests needed to be done 96 to 48 hours before departure (different rules for different states and countries), there is a possibility that a person who was found negative in those tests giving a positive report in tests done on arrival. This is not something done internationally in a majority of such cases," said a senior official of an Indian carrier. The UAE had earlier decided not to accept test reports from certain labs in India with whom this discrepancy was found a lot.

NEW DELHI: India has simplified the process of getting new types of aircraft as it opens its skies to flying machines not seen here commonly earlier like seaplanes and four-seater planes. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has removed the requirement of giving type acceptance of aircraft for short term wet leasing (hiring with operating crew) of aircraft in a bid to improve the ease of doing business in this crippled by Covid sector. âWet leasing of foreign aircraft under any exigency is permitted for a limited period of three months, which is extendable for another three months. Type acceptance of an aircraft type was mandatory for import and registration of aircraft in India, (including) for short term leasing of foreign aircraft by Indian operators. This requirement has been removed,â a senior DGCA official said. Under the subsidised regional connectivity scheme, India is opening up new routes that will require small aircraft, seaplanes and choppers. The change, brought about by amending the civil aviation requirement for âcriteria for leasing of aircraft by Indian operators,â is aimed at simplifying leasing of those types of planes not seen here earlier or commonly. The amendment does not change the maximum age requirement of 18 and 25 years for aircraft being brought in for passenger transportation and cargo operations, respectively. âWet, damp or dry lease is only permitted in emergency situations by DGCA. Situations cover unexpected grounding of aircraft of an existing (airline, charter operator), aircraft under unscheduled maintenance or checks or any other unforeseen circumstances. Such leases are not permitted for capacity or route expansion of an air transport (passenger) service except for cargo operations,â the amended rule says. However, the DGCA can give exemption from the maximum age condition for bringing in aircraft. Fo instance, SpiceJet wet-leased an almost 50-year-old 15-seater DHC-6 Twin Otter seaplane from Maldivian Aero, the countryâs national airline, last October for operating between Ahmedabadâs Sabarmati riverfront and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patelâs Stature of Unity in Kevadia. Following PM Modiâs direction, Airports Authority of India is developing water ports. The Centre had last year approved subsidised flights from six water airports that include Guwahati riverfront, Nagarjuna Sagar, Shatrunjay Dam and Umrangso reservoir under the third round of ude desh ka aam nagrik (Udan) scheme. The first to take off will be the seaplane service between Ahmedabad Sabarmati riverfront and the State of Unity. The routes awarded for seaplane operations include Sabarmati riverfront to Stature of Unity and Shatrunjay Dam; Guwahati riverfront to Umrango reservoir, Jorhat and Shillong and Nagarjuna Sagar to Vijaywada and Hyderabad. In August-end, the aviation ministry had approved 78 new routes under the fourth round of UDAN which could see Kavaratti water aerodrome in Lakshadweep also getting flights. Agatti, Kavaratti and Minicoy islands of Lakshadweep have also been connected by the new routes of UDAN 4.
