SRINAGAR: Lieutenant General BS Raju, General Officer Commander (GOC), Chinar Corps, on Sunday said that Pakistan continues to instigate youth from Kashmir Valley into terrorism by various means, indoctrinates and sends them back across Line of Control (LoC). Speaking exclusive to ANI, he added that terrorists from the neighbouring country also continue to target our security forces and civilians in crowded areas, expecting forces to react and cause more civilian casualties. "Pakistan remains the key instigator to push youth towards terrorism by various means. It has attracted many youths for studies. But along the way, a few have been indoctrinated. Some of them have trained and sent back through the Line of Control (LoC) as part of infiltrating columns as well as through the international border. Terrorists from Pakistan target our security forces and civilians within the Valley in crowded areas. They expect us to react and cause more civilian casualties. They then use this as propaganda to tarnish our image and then go for reacting," he said. Accusing Pakistan of using social media to spread misinformation and attract new recruits, Raju observed that terrorists encourage overground workers to throw grenades or fire pistol at low-value targets and also initiate them into terrorist ranks but people are aware of Pakistan's design. "The recruitment by terrorists in 2020 is fairly under control, especially when compared to 2018. The present strength of terrorists in the valley is 217, which is the lowest in last decade. Pakistan's desire to send weapons and drugs by drones/tunnel is definitely a challenge. Pakistan's basic desire is to destabilise Kashmir. As we became strong on the LC and were able to plug the gaps, Pakistan began to adopt alternate means of using drones to drop weapons. To defeat the use of drones, we are using advanced surveillance devices to detect and Jam these aerial platforms," he added further. "The use of tunnels by terrorists is basically prevalent in the Jammu region. The Army and the BSF have found many. In fact, we discovered one just a few days back. We are using many techniques to detect them, including use of Ground Penetrating Radars. The bottom line is we need to remain alert to plug all loopholes. In fact I would urge the local population must remain alert, especially for transportation drugs as it can weaken the system and corrupt the society," he added. The Army officer said that the technology and techniques are constantly being upgraded at Chinar Corps to prevent infiltration. "To begin with, we reworked our deployments with some analysis on the tech front. there is huge infusion of equipment for surveillance, for detection and subsequently for neutralisation our ability to detect and neutralise at night has also improved and that's how we have a number of successful contacts at night," he said. Hitting out at Pakistan for using ceasefire violations to help the terrorists infiltrate in the Valley, he added that during such situations the army in a way a way, that there is a clear disincentive for such behaviour from the other side. "My main message to youth - is you can get back and we will take care of you. This is a message we have consistently given to all stakeholders, whether it is terrorists, the parents, and the community. We have demonstrated the same on the ground too. In the last 6 months, 17 of those who had strayed have come back and we will take care of them. Presently we are working with the govt for a suitable surrender Policy. My appeal to the youth who have gone astray is to come back. They can get back anytime, including during operations. They can call anybody, their parents, our helpline and we will organise their return," he said. Raju while speaking about Chinar Corps role to help the locals added, "We are conscious that people are the centre of gravity and within that the youth remain our focus. In fact , our company operating basis enmeshed completely with locals of villages and towns Often the Company Commander is the first responder to any emergency, be it Fire, an accident, or a Drowning case. "Recently we have started the concept of a - Day with Company Commander. We also conduct large no of events - Sports, Village games, cultural, debates, skill development, painting all these are very well responded by the locals with great enthusiasm," he added.

NEW DELHI: UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has invited PM Narendra Modi to participate in-person for the G7 summit to be held in the Cornwall region from June 11 to 13. Johnson is expected to visit India ahead of the G7 summit. He cancelled his planned trip to be the chief guest at this year's Republic Day parade due to a surge in coronavirus cases in Britain. Boris Johnson says he wants to use Britain's presidency of the G7 to forge a consensus that the global economy must recover from the Covid-19 crisis in a pro-free trade and sustainable way. "Coronavirus is doubtless the most destructive force we have seen for generations and the greatest test of the modern world order we have experienced," he said in a statement. "It is only right that we approach the challenge of building back better by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future." The seaside resort of Carbis Bay will host the annual G-7 gathering of leaders from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the European Union starting on June 11. Apart from India, the UK has also invited leaders from Australia and South Korea amidst talk of expanding the grouping to include the three countries as well. Last year's G7 meeting was cancelled due to the pandemic, meaning the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Japan, the European Union and Canada have not met in person since the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, France. The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said the British government hoped the event would be the occasion for US President-elect Joe Biden's first trip to Europe after he becomes president on Jan. 20.

He formed his own party in 1972 following differences with M Karunanidhi, the then DMK chief after Annadurai's death. "Bharat Ratna MGR lives in the hearts of several people. Be it the world of films or politics, he was widely respected," Modi tweeted. Bharat Ratna MGR lives in the hearts of several people.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday is scheduled to hear that the Central government's application seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor rally or any other kind of protest which sought to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of the Republic Day on January 26. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde will hear the application on January 18 along with pleas raising the issue of farmers protesting at Delhi borders. The Centre, in an application filed through Delhi Police, has said that any proposed rally or protest which seeks to disrupt and disturb the Republic Day celebrations will cause an "embarrassment to the nation". On January 12, the top court agreed to hear the application of Centre and posted it for hearing on January 18. The Bench had issued a notice on the application and said that it be served upon the farmers' unions, which are protesting against the new farm laws. The Centre has said the right to protest can never include "maligning the nation globally". It urged the apex court to restrain anyone from conducting any protest march either in the form of tractor march, trolley march, vehicle march or any other mode by entering into the National Capital Region Territory of Delhi. Reports have claimed that farmer leaders have clarified that the tractor rally on January 26 will only take place at the Haryana-Delhi borders and the farmers are not planning to reach the Red Fort to disrupt the Republic Day parade as is being claimed by some. The top court on January 12 had stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders. Days after top court's order, Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee, part of the apex-court formed Committee, recused from the expert panel.

WASHINGTON: Less than 100 hours ahead of his historic inauguration, US President-elect Joe Biden has either nominated or named at least 20 Indian Americans, including 13 women, to key positions in his administration, a new record in itself for this small ethnic community that constitutes one per cent of the country's population. As many as 17 of them would be part of the powerful White House complex. The January 20th inauguration, the 59th in all, wherein Biden would be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States is already historic in the making as for the first time ever a woman Kamala Harris would be sworn as the vice president of the country. Harris, 56, is also the first ever Indian-origin and African American to be sworn in as the vice president of the United States. It is also for the first time ever that so many Indian-Americans have been roped into a presidential administration ever before the inauguration. Biden is still quite far away from filling all the positions in his administration. Topping the list is Neera Tanden, who has been nominated as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and Dr Vivek Murthy, who has been nominated as the US Surgeon General. President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget Neera Tanden (AP)President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to serve as Director of the Office of Management and Budget Neera Tanden (AP)Vanita Gupta has been nominated as associate attorney general Department of Justice, and on Saturday, Biden nominated a former foreign service official Uzra Zeya as the under secretary of state for civilian security, democracy, and human rights. Vanita Gupta, US President-elect Joe Biden's nominee to be associate attorney general (Reuters)âThe dedication that the Indian-American community has shown to public service over the years has been recognised in a big way at the very start of this administration! I am particularly pleased that the overwhelming majority are women. Our community has truly arrived in serving the nation,â Indiaspora founder M R Rangaswami told PTI. Mala Adiga has been appointed as policy director to the future First Lady Dr Jill Biden and Garima Verma would be the digital director of the Office of the First Lady, while Sabrina Singh has been named as her deputy press secretary. For the first time ever among the Indian-Americans include two who trace their roots to Kashmir: Aisha Shah, who has been named as partnership manager at the White House Office of Digital Strategy, and Sameera Fazili, who would occupy the key position of deputy director at the US National Economic Council (NEC) in the White House. White House National Economic Council also has another Indian American, Bharat Ramamurti, as deputy director. Gautam Raghavan, who served at the White House in the previous Obama Administration returns to the White House as Deputy Director in Office of Presidential Personnel. Among Biden's inner circle is his top confident for year Vinay Reddy, who has been named as director speechwriting. Young Vedant Patel all set to occupy a seat in the White House lower press, behind the briefing room, as assistant press secretary to the President. He is only the third-ever Indian American to be part of the White House press shop. Three Indian-Americans have made their way to the crucial National Security Council of the White House, thus leaving a permanent imprint on the country's foreign policy and national security. They are Tarun Chhabra: senior director for technology and national security, Sumona Guha, senior director for South Asia, Shanthi Kalathil: coordinator for democracy and human rights. Sonia Aggarwal has been named senior advisor for climate policy and innovation in the Office of the Domestic Climate Policy at the White House and Vidur Sharma has been appointed as policy advisor for testing for the White House Covid-19 Response Team. Two Indian Americans women have been appointed to the Office of the White House Counsel: Neha Gupta as associate counsel and Reema Shah as deputy associate counsel. Also, for the first time in any administration, the White House would have three other South Asians in key positions. Pakistani-American Ali Zaidi as deputy national climate advisor White House; Sri Lankan American Rohini Kosoglu as domestic policy advisor to the Vice President and Bangladeshi-American Zayn Siddique: senior advisor to the White House deputy chief of staff. During the campaign, Biden had indicated that he would rope in a large number of Indian Americans. âAs President, I'll also continue to rely on Indian-American diaspora, that keeps our two nations together, as I have throughout my career,â Biden had said in his address to the Indian-American community during a virtual celebration of India's Independence Day on August 15, 2020. âMy constituents in Delaware, my staff in the Senate, the Obama Biden administration, which had more Indian Americans than any other administration in the history of this country and this campaign with Indian Americans at senior levels, which of course includes the top of the heap, our dear friend (Kamala Harris) who will be the first Indian American vice president in the history of the United States of America,â Biden said in his video address.

PATNA: In âdryâ Bihar, he created a flourishing oasis of illicit liquor to build a fortune that he loved flaunting â luxury wheels, fancy phones and a designer lifestyle. Both luck and liquor ran out for 28-year-old Atul Singh, who has an MBA degree from a reputable Noida university, on Friday when Bihar police raided his rented accommodation at the cityâs Mahatma Gandhi Nagar. Over 1,100 litres of liquor worth Rs 21 lakh were found stocked in the house. Manoranjan Bharti, SHO, Patrakarnagar police station, said entries in Atulâs diary suggested he sold liquor worth around Rs 9 lakh a day in various parts of the city. The police are digging into his bank passbooks and documents related to monetary transactions to find out more about his business. Atul, a resident of Alawalpur village in Patna rural, told interrogators that he would employ jobless youths to deliver liquor to his customers across Patna. As per police, he paid Rs 500 for every successful delivery. Around 30 to 40 youths were involved in the trade. The police laid a trap for Atul following the arrest of two of his alleged accomplices, Indrajit Singh and Sanjiv Kumar. Initially, he tried to mislead the cops by claiming to be a management student. âHe produced an identity card of a Noida university. But the raid party had evidence and he was forced to make a confession,â the SHO told TOI on Saturday. Two rooms of the house were used to stock liquor supplied to him by four smugglers from Vaishali, police said. Raids are underway to nab suppliers. Police have also arrested his alleged associate Vishal Kumar. On Friday, Atul, Sanjiv and Indrajit were produced in a local court and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. Bharti said all four accused have been booked under Bihar Prohibition and Excise (Amendment) Act, 2018. A Honda Amaze car, a Kawasaki Ninja motorbike, Rs 1.75 lakh in cash and two iPhones are among the items confiscated from them.

NEW DELHI: In one of the longest meetings of the MEAâs consultative committee on Friday, foreign minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla answered questions on Indiaâs China strategy and foreign policy priorities. Congress MP Rahul Gandhi led the opposition charge against the government, demanding a âclear and concreteâ strategy rather than a âlaundry listâ of government achievements. In the three-and-half-hour meeting, sources said Jaishankar answered questions for over 2 hours and Shringla gave a detailed presentation for over 75 minutes. Jaishankar said Chinaâs actions of the sudden military buildup in eastern Ladakh had undermined peace and tranquillity. The governmentâs strategy at present was to hold the line militarily on the border areas and support the armed forces in their efforts. Jaishankar stressed that the real problem with China was the rapid growth of Indiaâs border infrastructure efforts, adding that this had been slow until 2014. Since then, the government had trebled the infrastructure budget and quadrupled the pace of implementation, according to official sources. Gandhi questioned whether the government had a strategy that could be âsummarised in three sentencesâ. More specifically, he asked, what India would do to counter a situation where Chinese strategy moves from the maritime to the terrestrial, where the old Silk Road is changed into a land route that links China to Europe (BRI) and through Pakistan (CPEC) to the Gulf in order to diminish Indiaâs centrality. He also asked whether India had a strategy to deal with a more âbipolarâ (read the US versus China) world. Jaishankar replied that Indiaâs strategy on the BRI and connectivity had been made clear from the first BRI Forum in 2017. Indiaâs position was now echoed by many other countries in the world, he said. India, he added, was working to creating a more multipolar world, of which the first step would be to create a multipolar Asia. Rahul Gandhi said he wanted the minutes to be circulated in advance. Jaishankar informed him that in previous years the minutes used to be circulated, but the practice had been stopped by Pranab Mukherjee when he was foreign minister for security reasons. Other MPs are also learnt to have red-flagged concerns over the dangers of protectionism and cautioning against too much âatma nirbhartaâ. Sources said Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, in particular, sought clarity on whether India proposed to take sides on US-China tensions or if it will continue to have it both ways. Among six questions he sought clarity on, Tharoor also asked whether Indiaâs âdysfunctional domestic politicsâ has provided an opportunity to Pakistan and China to âfish in troubled watersâ. Congress MP Anand Sharma, sources said, spoke about the importance of Afghanistan and why India has remained absent from the table in the Afghan peace process. Bhagwant Mann, T Chandrasekhar and Priyanka Chaturvedi also raised concerns over Indiaâs domestic politics creating the âwrong perceptionsâ especially in the context of difficulties faced by people on Vande Bharat flights and the migrants crises.

NEW DELHI: WhatsApp on Saturday said that it has delayed the implementation of its new privacy policy and terms of service until May 15. âThank you to everyone whoâs reached out. Weâre still working to counter any confusion by communicating directly with @WhatsApp users. No one will have their account suspended or deleted on Feb 8 and weâll be moving back our business plans until after May,â the company tweeted on Saturday, while sharing a blogpost on the microblogging platform. It also said it would instead âgo to people gradually to review the policy at their own pace before new business options are available on May 15.â On January 6, the instant messaging platform had announced that it was making it mandatory for users to share their data with its parent company, Facebook. It had not given an option to opt out of the changes and had said people would lose access by February 8, if they did not accept the new terms. The move, digital experts had said, was a blow to privacy as it maximised data collection. Reacting to WhatsAppâs new post, cyber security expert Jiten Jain pointed out that privacy concerns around the update still exist since WhatsApp has not rolled back the policy. âThey have just delayed the new policy. Itâs only a tactic to escape public anger and stop the mass exodus of people to other platforms,â he said. The blog post said there had been a âlot of misinformation causing concern (around the new policy) and we want to help everyone understand our principles and facts.â It said WhatsApp would continue to protect users through end-toend encryption, a method which doesnât allow the company to read content of peopleâs messages. âItâs why we donât keep logs of who everyoneâs messaging or calling. We also canât see your shared location and we donât share your contacts with Facebook. None of that is changing,â it wrote, adding that âThis update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook.â In another tweet, WhatsApp said, ânever planned to delete any accounts based on this and will not do so in future.â

NEW DELHI: As the demand for work under MGNREGS during the pandemic unemployment shot through the roof, the share of work per household slipped by four days. Surprising as it seems, the average employment per household was 48.40 days in 2019-20 when the number of families that worked under the job scheme was 5.48 crore. In contrast, the employment per household has gone down to 44.38 days in 2020-21 when the number of families has zoomed to 6.90 crore. Under MGNREGA, every household is entitled to 100 days of work per year. Also, total persondays generated in 2019-20 was 265.38 crore as against 306.39 crore in the pandemic year when formal employment took a serious hit due to the lockdown. It implies while more households sought and found work under the job scheme this year, the individual share of employment was lower. Interpretations and reasons vary. While the government believes the temporary share in MGNREGA of migrants who returned to villages skewed the figures, job scheme activists say the administrations have not been able to generate work owing to the surge as well as budgetary constraints resulting in a serious gap between the demand and work given. âThe overall figures may be hiding two averages. The migrants sought work in villages and later went back to cities. These additional workers are not seeking work any more under MGNREGA but are dragging down the per family share. If the migrants are taken out of the calculation, the work per household may go up. It requires a detailed study,â a senior rural development ministry official said. The rise in work demand without concomitant increase in work per household (HH) is a national pattern. In Uttar Pradesh, the average HH work dropped from 46 days in 2019-20 to 38 days in 2020-21 even as the number of families working went up from 53.14 lakh to 88 lakh. In Bihar, it has fallen from 42 days to 39 days, Chhattisgarh from 55.69 days to 43.17 days and Maharashtra from 41 days to 35 days. Here, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh are exceptions â Odisha per HH average has gone up from 48 days to 49 days and in MP, from 53 days to 55 days. It is to be seen if the remaining two and half months in the financial year change the average since overwhelming number of migrants are said to have since returned to the cities.

RAMPUR: In another trouble for senior Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Azam Khan, the Rampur district administration on Saturday issued orders for acquisition of 173 acres of land belonging to Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar Trust, which is run and owned by Khanâs family. The court of additional district magistrate (admin) JP Gupta ruled that the trust had violated norms while purchasing the land and ordered the SDM to acquire the varsity land. Additional district government counsel (civil) Ajay Tiwari said, âThe trust had violated the government order (GO) that permitted it to purchase more than 12 acres only on the condition that it will have to follow rules laid down by the GO. It said the trust would not buy land belonging to people from SC/ST categories, nor acquire riverbeds or floodplains or any land belonging to gram samaj land or a chak road. But the trust violated these terms as well as sections of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Act.â âThe court had also issued notices and summons to Azam Khan, the chairman of the trust earlier, at Sitapur jail but he had refused to receive the notices,â Tiwari said. In January 2020, a revenue board court in Prayagraj had also directed the government to take over around 100 bighas of land in Rampur allegedly purchased from 12 Dalit farmers under coercion.

NEW DELHI: Newsprint cost has jumped 20% in the last three months due to demandsupply imbalance post pandemic, prompting news publishers to petition the government for waiver of 5% import duty to help cut cost. The industry has been hit hard due to Covid-19 led disruptions and the most newspapers have stopped sending newspapers to rural areas where there is less than 50 copies to reduce the distribution cost, said the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) president L Adimoolam. In a representation to the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming union budget, INS has suggested to take steps as to reduce the customs duty on import of newsprints, a stimulus package for the industry or at least to help the publications by releasing advertisement with an increased tariff of 50%. It has also asked to extend the validity of Registrar of Newspapers for India (RNI) Circulation Certificates up to March 31, 2022 which will enable DAVP rates to remain the same till next year. It is estimated that the print media would take two or three years to recover from the current situation, the INS added. When asked about the situation, Adimoolam said, âWe have been asking for the stimulus package. The government is helping a few industries with stimulus packages. We are (also) expecting some stimulus.â After the pandemic, reportedly 3 million tonnes of newsprint capacities have been closed or converted to brown paper grades worldwide, resulting in a demandsupply imbalance. âPrices of newsprint have shot up by 20% in the last three months. Another increase of 10-15% is in the anvil next month which will severely impact the publishers,â said the INS in the memorandum.
