BRASILIA: Brazil's newly launched vaccination campaign against Covid-19 has gotten off to a late and rocky start -- as the country is hammered by a second wave of the disease, it is already close to running out of vaccine, syringes and other vital equipment, according to scientists who blame the government of Jair Bolsonaro. The campaign only began on Monday in the country of 212 million, weeks after the United States and European countries launched their vaccination programs. The late rollout, hampered by short supplies, has sparked growing public ire, with widespread complaints about people being vaccinated out of turn. Thousands of people in several cities mounted protests this weekend demanding Bolsonaro's ouster. The inoculation drive so far involves six million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine from China's Sinovac, and two million of the British AstraZeneca-Oxford jab, which arrived Friday after several delays from India where they are made. The Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, associated with Sinovac, has also received authorization for another 4.8 million doses of CoronaVac. But no sooner had the vaccination program begun than professionals sounded the alarm about delays. This comes at a time when the pandemic has been surging, claiming more than 1,000 lives a day and more than 215,000 to date, second only to the US total of over 415,000. Any interruption in the supply chain could bring the vaccination program to a sudden halt, according to Isabella Ballalai, vice president of the Brazilian Society for Immunology (SBIM). She denounced what she called "the incompetence of the Health Ministry" and said greater transparency is needed to restore public confidence. Bolsonaro, who has long played down the seriousness of Covid-19, on Friday cast doubt on the effectiveness of vaccines. The government acknowledged this month that it lacked 30 million syringes for the first phase of its national plan, which aims -- over an unclear timeline -- to immunize 50 million people. On top of the distribution challenges in this vast country, complaints have arisen in several cities about people getting vaccinated even when not in a priority group. In Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, where hospitals are overflowing with Covid patients and oxygen supplies are critically short, the outcry of complaints led to a 24-hour suspension of vaccinations. The Butantan Institute has said it expects eventually to be able to produce 40 million doses of the CoronaVac; the Fiocruz foundation, which has links to the Health Ministry, is supposed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine but has warned of supply chain problems. Many experts attribute the delays to Bolsonaro's frequent criticism of the CoronaVac vaccine, which they say has offended the Chinese. The only explanation, said Margareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist and researcher at Fiocruz, is "absolute negligence, the diplomatic incompetence of Brazil." Bolsonaro on Thursday rejected such criticism, saying the problem "is bureaucratic and not political." Thomaz Favaro, a political analyst with Control Risks, pointed a finger at the government, which he said "delayed in signing agreements with the laboratories." Brazil has yet to reach agreement to purchase either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Janssen vaccine. But Favaro said Bolsonaro will eventually have to pay a political price, adding, "the delay in the vaccination campaign has a serious impact on economic recovery, and that will increase people's frustration." A new poll Friday showed Bolsonaro's popularity is at its lowest point -- 31 percent -- since he came to office in January 2019.

KLINY, Czech Republic: In a dog training centre built inside a shipping container located in a Czech mountain village, Renda, Cap and Laky are being put to the test. They sniff at six vessels, each containing a piece of cloth with scent from patients with Covid-19, negative donors, or fake samples. "Good boy!" exclaims Lenka Vlachova, a trainer working at Prague's fire brigade, as jagdterrier Renda sits down by one sample, wagging his tail. The team of dog trainers are working in their own time and report a 95-percent success rate in Covid-19 detection in samples of human scent. "The study is designed to verify dogs' ability to detect Covid-19 and generate a method enabling the use of trained dogs in combatting the pandemic," project head Gustav Hotovy told AFP. "The method should also work with other diseases, even more lethal than Covid-19," Hotovy said. "In the end, we should be able to detect a huge number of people in a very short time with a trained dog," he said, speaking in the snowy village of Kliny near the German border. Vlachova told AFP the first study confirming dogs are able to detect tissue attacked by a virus was conducted in the United States about a decade ago. "The virus changes the human tissue, affecting the scent signature of the person," she said. Hotovy, a retired cynologist whose team started training the dogs last August, said that the signature changes "so much that it is immediately discernible for the dogs". The samples used are obtained merely by rubbing a piece of cotton against the patient's skin. The team then has to ensure the sample is virus-free to prevent the dogs from catching the disease. Using the same sampling method, a Finnish team has been using dogs for testing at Helsinki airport, reporting its dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy. Vlachova said the Czechs would like to work together with the Finns or with French and German teams working on similar projects. Unlike their western peers, the Czech team works in its free time and relies on scant financial means provided by a local dog food maker. Cynologist Katerina Jancarikova said the virus-affected tissue made up "just a tiny fragment in the overall scent, a part of the dogs' puzzle". "It's like looking for Wally," she said, referring to the popular children's books in which a tiny character in red and white stripes has to be found in pictures of a huge crowd. Jancarikova said any dog can be trained for detection as long as it is cooperative. As Vlachova led Renda back to the van, Hotovy walked into the training centre with a sturdy giant schnauzer named Laky who eagerly sniffed at the vessels, placed in a different pattern, before easily identifying the positive one. "He was once reluctant to cooperate," he chuckled, adding that the dogs showed the same eager response when let loose in a nearby house where a guest who tested positive for Covid-19 had been staying. "They immediately jumped at his bed with the same happy reaction they show over a positive sample in the centre," he said.

PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron said Saturday the law had to change to better protect victims of child sexual abuse, after thousands shared their stories in response to a newly published book. "Today shame is switching sides" from victims to perpetrators, Macron said in a video posted to Twitter, welcoming the fact that "people feel free to speak everywhere in France". The flood of testimony under the social media hashtag #Metooinceste followed the early January publication of a book, "La familia grande", by Camille Kouchner. In it she accused her step-father, prominent political commentator Olivier Duhamel, of having abused her twin brother. Macron did not directly address that case. But in a short video posted to Twitter, he promised those speaking out online: "We are here. We're listening to you. We believe you. And you will never be alone again." And he added: "We have to adapt our laws to better protect child victims of incest and sexual violence." Promising to "punish criminals for their acts in the past and prevent them ever reoffending", Macron said the law would be updated. In 2018, France already pushed back the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against minors to 30 years. But some people have argued such acts should never fall beyond the reach of the justice system. "No-one can ignore these experiences any longer," Macron said. "We have to hear and gather victims' testimonies even years, decades afterwards."

CARACAS: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday he was willing to "turn the page" with the US under President Joe Biden, calling for a "new path" after years of tension with Donald Trump's White House. "We are willing to walk a new path in our relations with Joe Biden's government based on mutual respect, dialogue, communication and understanding," the leftist leader told supporters, adding that he "is willing to turn the page" with the new US administration. Trump's government had slapped multiple economic sanctions on Venezuela, including an oil embargo in place since 2019, in an attempt to overthrow the socialist regime of Maduro, whom the US has labeled a dictator. After years of a frosty relationship Caracas and Washington fully broke diplomatic ties on January 23, 2019, when the US government recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. After Biden won the US presidential election in November, Maduro congratulated the longtime politician, saying Venezuela was "ready for dialogue and good understanding with the people and government of the United States," repeating those sentiments again in December. Analysts believe the Biden administration will take a more moderate stance on Venezuela and will support international mediation for the transition towards a new government. That said, Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, has already described Maduro as a "brutal dictator," and during his Senate confirmation hearing said he supported Trump's policy of backing Guaido. The renewed support for Guaido follows the swearing in of a new pro-Maduro Venezuelan National Assembly following December elections boycotted by the opposition, who claimed fraud. The new parliament technically left Guaido, the chamber's former speaker, without a job, although he plans to maintain a parallel body of shadow opposition lawmakers that has gained foreign backing. According to the UN, more than five million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015, fleeing political and economic turmoil.

PARIS: Portuguese voters have been asked to venture out despite the country's pandemic lockdown Sunday for a presidential election widely expected to see centre-right incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa win another term. Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people. But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform -- and whether a plunge in turnout could produce an upset. At stake is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power. Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases. The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday bringing fatalities to over 10,000. More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its 10.8 million people, according to an AFP tally based on government figures. Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants. In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round. That would "spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said. "An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable," the 72-year-old warned. Lower turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent. A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way. Nevertheless, in a long political career "I've seen more failures than victories, so I keep things in perspective", "Marcelo" said recently when asked if he hadn't been campaigning hard enough. "When I lost it wasn't the end of the world. And when I won, I didn't think I was the best." Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government. He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist. Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- "Enough" -- says he is in the running to "crush the Left", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates. Portugal has so far been largely spared the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years. Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.

WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will review the Trump dispensation's "peace deal" with the Taliban to determine whether the insurgent group has reduced attacks in Afghanistan in keeping with its side of the agreement, the White House said on Friday. White House officials said President Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib and "made clear the US' intention to review" the deal, specifically if Taliban is "living up to its commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders." Sullivan, a White House statement said, "underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent ceasefire." He also discussed US support for steps to protect women and minority groups' rights as part of the peace process. The Biden move will bring some relief to both Kabul and New Delhi, which feared that the Trump administration threw then under the bus by giving away too much in return for sketchy assurances from the Taliban. The Trump White House made it obvious it was in a hurry to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan and other theaters as part of the former President's disdain for Washington's involvement in "foreign wars" regardless of US stakes previous administrations talked up. Under the deal signed in February 2020 between Trump and Taliban representatives, the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled, and proceeding with national peace talks. The deal, based on thin assurance with sketchy guarantees, thrilled Pakistan, which regards Afghanistan as its "strategic depth" and a staging ground to counter India and assert itself in the region. The Biden review though is underscored by assurance by the new Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Washington is still committed to ending this "forever war" but it also wants to "retain some capacity to deal with any resurgence of terrorism, which is what brought us there in the first place." Friday's developments made it clear that the US would continue to have differences with friends and allies, but it would mark the return of a "friendly and respectful" tone, as Mexico characterized the conversation between Biden and Obrador. âItâs not always going to be perfect alignment with the United States. Thatâs the case with any given president, but weâre in a situation where we are much more aligned on values and focus. I am very much looking forward to working with President Biden," Canada's Trudeau, stung by Biden's first-day move of scrapping the Keystone XL pipeline that would help the Canadian economy, said. The Biden White House has already indicated it sees a continuation of good relations with India in keeping with the bipartisan support New Delhi has in Washington. âPresident Biden, who, of course, has visited India many times, respects and values the long, bipartisan, successful relationship between leaders in India and the United States. He looks forward to a continuation of that,â White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Thursday, suggesting also that the election of the first US vice-president of Indian-origin would help this. Biden visited India in 2008 and 2013, and in quirky asides, has twice referred to distant relatives and family in India -- five Bidens in Mumbai who may have descended from his âgreat, great, great, great, great grandfatherâ George Biden, who was a Captain in the East India Trading company and settled in India after marrying locally.

Trump's extreme-right backers angry and not going anywhere

WASHINGTON: The American far right is angry: Angry at Joe Biden, angry at Donald Trump, angry at the enigmatic "Q" and angry with themselves. The online postings and chatrooms of extremists have been brimming with disappointment and dissent since the failed January 6 insurrection against Congress and the inauguration of Joe Biden as president. Followers of the QAnon conspiracy movement -- and its Delphic prophet Q -- are most in disarray, their millenarian predictions of chaos and doom accompanying Biden's elevation to the presidency not (or not yet) coming true. Ultranationalists like the Proud Boys, armed militias such as the Oath Keepers, and dangerous white supremacists and neo-Nazis have been pushed further underground, with followers who took part in the Capitol attack being swept up by law enforcement. Experts in extremism and domestic terrorism say these groups have been dealt a blow by Trump's exit from power. But they also maintain that the groups are not disappearing, and in some ways are now more motivated toward undertaking more dangerous attacks. The more extreme groups are looking at the large pool of disheartened QAnon types for recruits, they say. "The rhetoric remains heated, people are not cooling off. They are not adjusting well to Biden," said Michael Edison Hayden, senior investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which researches extremism. Far from depleted, said Colin P. Clarke, Director of Policy and Research at The Soufan Group, "the energy and momentum that the far right has is stronger than any time in recent memory. "The question is, what happens next?" Many expected that Trump's exit and the expulsion of extremists from Facebook, Twitter, Parler and other social media would calm things. Instead, it has added to the furor and galvanized the disparate far-right groups. "They are far more united in what they are against than what they are for" said Clarke. Hayden said the deplatforming by social media companies of users they consider beyond the pale is "becoming a unifying grievance." Most have relocated to a few welcoming platforms, foremost Telegram, where new QAnon and Proud Boys pages have hundreds of thousands of followers. "The infrastructure really still exists" for the far right to convene, said Hayden. QAnon began in late 2017 with cryptic statements from the mysterious Q on the 8kun website. No one knew who Q was, but his statements mobilized Trump followers to believe there was a Democratic and "deep state" plot against the president. As time passed they absorbed other conspiracy theories, including one about a global child kidnapping racket, and bizarre end-of-times predictions. And Trump's tweets, campaigns and rallies became a focal point for Q followers. After his election defeat, they gave momentum to his "Stop the Steal" campaign centered on the false claim that Biden's victory was somehow fraudulent. That led directly to the January 6 Washington insurrection in Trump's name that left five dead. But Biden's inauguration Wednesday and Trump's quiet departure to Florida closed that door. Many are even angry that Trump hasn't clearly defended the more than 120 who arrested and hundreds more under investigation for the Capitol attack. But the far right "is coming to terms with" his departure and regrouping without him, said Hayden. QAnon followers though were dealt a second shock. On Wednesday Ron Watkins, whose father controls 8kun and who many believe is or knows the real "Q," announced he was quitting the movement and wiped out all of 8kun's QAnon archives. "We gave it our all. Now we need to keep our chins up and go back to our lives as best as we are able," he posted on Telegram. "We have a new president sworn in and it is our responsibility as citizens to respect the Constitution." "That was a massive body-blow to the movement," said Karim Zidan, an investigator for Right Wing Watch. But Zidan said the movement has proven it can live without Q. QAnon "influencers" with tens of thousands of followers, and the public figures who drove Trump's "Stop the Steal" campaign, like attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell and ex-national security advisor Michael Flynn, are inspiring the movement to continue. Wood, for example, picked up 592,000 followers in just one week after moving to Telegram, said Zidan. Powell has some 300,000. Worrying is the potential for moderate QAnon and Proud Boys followers to be "radicalized" online by more violent right-wing extremists. They only have to peel off a small portion from those groups to build networks capable of destructive violence, noted Clarke. "There are people out there committed to attacks," he said. He compared the level of anger to the early 1990s, which saw several domestic attacks including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 165, by anti-government extremists. "The possibility for violence remains high," said Hayden.

The Houseâs single article of impeachment â âinciting an insurrectionâ by stoking a mob into storming the Capitol â will be ceremoniously delivered on Monday to the Senate chamber, and read aloud.  But House Democratic impeachment managers and Trumpâs defence team then have until the week of February 8 to draft opposing briefs. The deal for this deferred timetable resolves one of Bidenâs main challenges â providing days in-between to potentially fill the presidentâs cabinet and begin work on his Covid-relief plan. It also reflects a compromise with McConnell, who urged setting a timetable that would have pre-trial arguments filed by February 11.

In guidelines posted on its website on Thursday, the CDC said that patients may switch between the two authorised vaccines â one by Pfizer and BioNTech, the other by Moderna â between the first and second doses in âexceptional situationsâ. The CDC also said patients may extend the interval between doses to six weeks from three or four if giving the second dose sooner was ânot feasible.â Until now, the CDC had cautioned against any dosing changes, saying there was no evidence for it.

LONDON: UK prime minister Boris Johnson is believed to be the first world leader outside North America and the third leader in the world to get a call from new US president Joe Biden in what is seen as significant boost to UK-US relations post Brexit. The two leaders spoke on Saturday and vowed to deepen the special relationship between the USA and Britain and drive a green and sustainable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between the two countries. The call to the UK prime minister on Saturday evening follows Biden's first two calls after entering the White House which he made to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Friday. This makes Johnson the first leader outside North America to get the coveted phone call â ahead of the likes of Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, the Irish prime minister. Biden has Irish roots. Johnson tweeted a photo of the call and said: âGreat to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: âThe Prime Minister congratulated the President on his inauguration and the two leaders looked forward to deepening the close alliance between our nations.â The two leaders noted the significant challenges facing the world during the pandemic, but also the unparalleled opportunities to âbuild back better and greener togetherâ. The UK Prime Minister praised President Bidenâs early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050.  âThe Prime Minister warmly welcomed the Presidentâs decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organization and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,â Number 10 said. Building on the UK and USâ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and their shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy.  âThey also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible,â Downing Street added.  âThe leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and COP26 this year.â Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending the G7 summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall in Britain from 11 to 13 June.

ISLAMABAD: The United Nations has cautioned staff of all its agencies across the world against using any Pakistan-registered airline, including the national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), due to concerns about the dubious flying licences of its pilots. The news about fake licenses of PIA pilots was revealed by the countryâs aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan on the floor of the National Assembly last year in July. An advisory issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS), stated: âDue to an ongoing investigation of the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) Pakistanâ¦due to dubious licenses caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators.â The UN advisory against flying on Pakistan-registered carriers was recommended to all the UN agencies, including the UN Development Programme, World Health Organization, UN High Commission for Refugees, Food and Agriculture Organization, UN Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization and others. It signifies that UN officials working in Pakistan cannot travel by any Pakistan-registered airline even domestically. The Pakistan-registered airlines listed in the advisory include PIA, Air Eagle, Air Indus, Air Blue, Aircraft Sales and Services, Askari Aviation, Hawk Adventure Air, Hybrid Aviation, IAMC Airline, Meezab Aviation, Rayyan Air, Serene Air, Star Air Aviation and Vision Air International. The UNSMS has allowed its personnel to travel even by the Afghanistan-registered Kam Air. However, it noted that Afghanistan has an under-performing civil aviation authority as per the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO)âs audit programme, but the airline is authorised to conduct flight operations into multiple international airports. It is subject to an external audit. The advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a newly launched automated system, linked to a newly revised methodology and global air travel safety policy. Information and analysis generated by the Commercial Air Travel Safety Unit (CATSU) in relation to aviation safety is intended for UNSMS use only and is confidential. Such information may be shared with other UN recipients and third parties strictly on a need-to-know basis and provided suitable mechanisms are in place to maintain confidentiality. The advisory was issued sometime after the Pakistan aviation minister had dropped a bombshell alleging that hundreds of Pakistani pilots had dubious licences. Additionally, Pakistan has paid around $7 million to the Peregrine Aviation Charlie Ltd in the case pertaining to two jets leased to it by the Dublin-based AerCap. Itâs over the same case that the Malaysian authorities last Friday seized a PIA Boeing-777 at the Kuala Lumpur airport on the orders of a local court over the non-payment of aircraft lease dues owed to the AerCap.

LAHORE: A Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court has sentenced three leaders of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed's Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) terrorist organisation to six months in prison in a case of terror financing. Saeed's brother-in-law Hafiz Abdur Rehman Makki, JuD spokesperson Yahya Mujahid and Zafar Iqbal were handed down the six-month imprisonment each by the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore.  With Friday's sentencing, the collective imprisonment of Mujahid and Iqbal has climbed to 80 and 56 years respectively.  The verdicts against them will run concurrently in the terror financing cases registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab police.  "ATC-II Presiding Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta announced the verdict in FIR No 32 of 2019 against Zafar Iqbal, Abdul Rehman Makki and Yahya Mujahid," a court official told .  The three convicts were present in the court when the judge announced the verdict, he said.  The CTD had registered as many as 41 cases against the leaders of the JuD in different cities of Punjab, the court official said, adding that the trial courts have so far decided 37 cases.  In a recent verdict, operations commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi was given a 15-year imprisonment on three counts in a case of terror financing.  Early this week, the ATC handed down a 14-year imprisonment each to Iqbal and Mujahid while a six-month sentence to Makki in another terror financing case.  The ATC has sentenced Saeed for a collective imprisonment of 36 years on terror finance charges in five cases so far. His jail terms will run concurrently.  The LeT, led by JuD chief Saeed, is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.  Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a $10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17 last year in the terror financing cases. The 70-year-old JuD chief is lodged at Lahore's high-security Kot Lakhpat jail.  The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.  The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.  The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic.

ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and senior Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Friday said that the sooner Pakistan decides to do away with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the better, reported Geo News. Referring to the Broadsheet LLC scandal and criticising the country's accountability watchdog for the "corruption therein" Abbasi said that the sooner the state decides to abolish the bureau, the better it would be for the country. Abbasi who is also the General-Secretary of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an 11-party alliance of Pakistan that had led demonstrations across Pakistan against the Imran-led government on the charges of corruption termed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government "the most corrupt government in power at present". "Many other people are going to be exposed in the Broadsheet scandal," he said. The Broadsheet LLC case details the entire saga from the NAB's establishment to the signing and -- three years later -- rescinding the agreement with Broadsheet, a breach of contract, illegal payments from Pakistan to wrong entities; and all that led the court to ascertain that the anti-corruption body was involved in intentional wrongdoings, reported The News International. The Broadsheet LLC, based in the Isle of Man, was hired by the NAB during Musharraf's regime to trace out hidden assets of Pakistanis in foreign countries. NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003, reported The Express Tribune. Regarding the appointment of former Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed to head the Broadsheet Inquiry, Abbasi said that he "requests Azmat Saeed not to head the inquiry because he himself was part of NAB." "Don't be a part of the deal which puts the country's honour at stake," he said.Justice (retd) Azmat Saeed was employed as the deputy prosecutor general of NAB in the year 2000 for a period of one year. He was appointed special prosecutor of NAB in 2001 to pursue cases before the accountability courts at Attock Fort and Rawalpindi, reported Geo News. Abbasi further said that the Broadsheet scandal is not about probing corruption worth a few million rupees but it is the "story of destroying politics in the country." He also urged the PTI government to make the Broadsheet LLC inquiry transparent and share its findings with the public. The accountability watchdog (NAB) has been mired in controversy over violation of human rights, character assassination and arresting people at the inquiry stage to weaken the opposition's anti-government movement.

NEW DELHI: In another India-Pakistan face-off at the UN, after Pakistan co-sponsored a resolution promoting a culture of peace, India described as a matter of great irony that a country where a Hindu temple was recently demolished, and where minority rights are being emasculated, was introducing such a resolution. The UN General Assembly on Thursday adopted the resolution, promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites, that condemned all acts or threats of violence, destruction, damage or endangerment, directed against religious sites as such, that continue to occur in the world, and denounced any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites. The resolution was co-sponsored by Pakistan along with 21 other nations. India, in the explanation of position on the resolution, cited attacks on the Hindu temple in the Pakistani town of Karak, against a Sikh gurdwara as well as destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas in Afghanistan, and said in the world of growing terrorism, violent extremism, radicalisation and intolerance, religious sites and cultural heritage sites remain vulnerable to terrorist acts, violence and destruction. âThe resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,â said India, reiterating its call for application of principles of objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality to form the basis of discussions at the UN.

DHAKA: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has thanked her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for sending over two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine as a gift to Bangladesh. India on Thursday officially handed over 2 million doses of domestically produced Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh. The vaccines were provided at a crucial time when the number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh is rising. "I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for sending the vaccine (batch) as a gift," Hasina said at an online international conference held on the occasion of the 100th founding anniversary of the University of Dhaka on Thursday.  She said the government has already planned how it would proceed with the vaccine, the Dhaka Tribune reported.  "We have taken all the steps to face the Covid-19 situation in the country," Hasina said.  Apart from the current delivery of vaccines, Bangladesh is also set to purchase 3 crore doses of India-made coronavirus vaccine. Hasina hoped that the vaccine that Bangladesh procured from India would arrive by January 25-26, the report said. Bangladesh has so far recorded 7,966 Covid-19 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, while the total number of infections have surged to over 530,270.  India also handed over 1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to Nepal on Thursday. On Wednesday, India sent 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Bhutan and 100,000 doses to the Maldives.

As vaccines gifted by India reached Kathmandu and Dhaka on Thursday, it was the culmination of a series of steps by the government to keep the focus on the immediate neighbourhood as the world struggled with a pandemic. On Friday, a consignment containing 1.5 million doses of Covishield vaccines will reach Yangon, Myanmar. On Thursday, one million doses of vaccines landed in Nepal and 2 million doses landed in Dhaka. Except for Sri Lanka and Afghanistan (which have not yet given regulatory clearances), India has supplied the first doses of vaccines to almost all its immediate neighbours. Interestingly, Pakistan gave emergency authorisation to the AstraZeneca vaccine last week, but itâs not yet clear where it would source the vaccine from. Beyond the immediate neighbourhood, India is also looking to provide Covid-19 vaccine to important defence and security partners in the Indian Ocean with a consignment of 100,000 doses likely to reach Mauritius, and another 50,000 doses to Seychelles, on Friday. India has already donated Covishield vaccine to Sri Lanka and Maldives. âIndiaâs vaccine diplomacy demonstrates Indiaâs role as a reliable partner and a net provider of humanitarian assistance in the Indian Ocean region,â said a source.

The vaccines being made in India will also contribute to the global efforts to contain the pandemic," Modi wrote on the microblogging platform. India, one of the world's biggest drugmakers, has been approached by numerous countries for its anti-coronavirus doses. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield is being manufactured by the Serum Institute, the Covaxin doses are being produced by Bharat Biotech. India had earlier supplied hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir and paracetamol tablets, as well as diagnostic kits, ventilators, masks, gloves and other medical supplies to a large number of countries to help them deal with the pandemic.

LONDON: UK prime minister Boris Johnson is believed to be the first world leader outside North America and the third leader in the world to get a call from new US president Joe Biden in what is seen as significant boost to UK-US relations post Brexit. The two leaders spoke on Saturday and vowed to deepen the special relationship between the USA and Britain and drive a green and sustainable recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between the two countries. The call to the UK prime minister on Saturday evening follows Biden's first two calls after entering the White House which he made to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican president AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador on Friday. This makes Johnson the first leader outside North America to get the coveted phone call â ahead of the likes of Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin, the Irish prime minister. Biden has Irish roots. Johnson tweeted a photo of the call and said: âGreat to speak to President @JoeBiden this evening.

LONDON: AugustaWestland chopper scam accused British national Christian Michel who has been languishing in Tihar Jail for two years has written a handwritten letter to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, foreign secretary Dominic Raab and home secretary Priti Patel calling on the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) to intervene in his case, claiming his extradition from Dubai to India was politically-motivated and that he has been tortured. In the 35-page correspondence, which his lawyer, Toby Cadman, of Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, released on Saturday, Michel, 54, sets out his dismay at the failings of the British government to help and claims he was handed over to the Indian authorities âunlawfullyâ by the UAE âas part of a quid pro quo for the return of Sheikha Latifaâ. In March 2018, the 35-year-old daughter of Dubaiâs billionaire ruler was intercepted on a yacht about 50 miles off the coast of Goa in a joint India-UAE operation and sent back to Dubai. Michel was extradited from Dubai to India on December 4, 2018. In the letter, dated January 7, Michel writes that the first request for his extradition from the UAE to India failed and the second request âcoincided with the handing over of Sheikha Latifa to Dubai by the Indian authoritiesâ. He states that the Indian government âreinstated the extradition procedureâ two days after a meeting took place between him and a senior CBI official in May 2018 after he ârefused to cooperate in signing a 20-page confession incriminating himselfâ. Michel also claims that whilst imprisoned in Dubai, awaiting extradition, he was prevented from accessing his lawyer and denied private consular access. In Tihar jail, he claims he has been subjected to ârepeated and prolonged interrogations aimed at securing a confession by way of duressâ, as well as âinhuman or degrading treatment thatâ¦ constitutes torture.â In April 2019, Cadman filed an urgent communication with the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture against both the UAE and India with regard to Michel. âWe fully expect the UN Working Group to rule that Christian is being arbitrarily detained and recommend his immediate release. That ruling is imminent,â he said. âThe process that led to his removal from the UAE was a politically motivated decision. This extradition process can only be defined as a political extradition or better, a political rendition. The complete lack of due process is utterly unacceptable. He has been detained in conditions that can only be described in flagrant breach of the fundamental guarantees under national and international law. The FCDO must take immediate steps to intervene,â Cadman said. Michel is accused of bribing and criminally conspiring with Indian officials to win a contract on behalf of British helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland for 12 VVIP helicopters in 2010 and of receiving Rs 375 crore (â¬ 42.27million) in kickbacks for securing the deal.

LONDON: Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been expected to trumpet a rare success in the campaign against the coronavirus Friday: news that Britain had vaccinated 5.4 million people. By the end of the day, it was overtaken by a tentative finding that a new variant of the virus may be deadlier than the original. That possibility, raised by preliminary studies relying on small numbers of deaths in hard-hit hospitals, remains far from conclusive. But the prospect that the fast-spreading new variant, already known to be more contagious, could also be more lethal compounded fears that even with the arrival of vaccines, the pandemic will remain a severe threat for some time. Government scientists said the early evidence suggests that the new variant, first detected late last year in Britain, could raise the risk of death by some 30%. But even with such an increase, the great majority of cases are not fatal, and the government estimates included a broad range of possible effects. âUK strain is here but no need to panicââIn addition to spreading more quickly,â Johnson said at a news conference, âit also now appears that there is some evidence that the new variant â the variant that was first identified in London and the southeast â may be associated with a higher degree of mortality.â The underlying evidence, outlined in a report published Friday by a government scientific committee, was less emphatic than the prime minister, saying only that there was a ârealistic possibilityâ that the new variant was deadlier and outlining a number of inescapable limitations in the data. âI want to stress that thereâs a lot of uncertainty around these numbers and we need more work to get a precise handle on it, but it obviously is a concern that this has an increase in mortality as well as an increase in transmissibility,â said the governmentâs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Virus strain to cause more deaths in Britain: StudyBritainâs struggle with the pandemic has increasingly become a race between vaccinating the public and confronting mutations in the virus, like the new variant that now accounts for a significant percentage of new cases around the country. It is a pitched battle that scientists say evokes hope as well as anxiety. â2021 is going to be a cat-and-mouse game to see if we can vaccinate people quickly enough to stay ahead of the variants,â said Devi Sridhar, director of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh.

LONDON: Fugitive economic offender Vijay Mallyaâs barrister confirmed for the first time in a British court that the 65-year-old has applied for asylum, which is why he has not been sent back to India despite the UK courts having upheld Indiaâs extradition request to send him back in May 2020 to face charges of fraud by false representation, conspiracy to defraud, and laundering money. Philip Marshall QC, representing Mallya in his bankruptcy proceedings in the high court â which have been brought by the consortium of Indian banks to whom Mallya owes Â£1.05 billion (Rs 10,467 crore) â on Friday, whilst making an application for Â£2.8 million (about Rs 28 crore) from the court funds office to fund Mallyaâs legal fees and living expenses, was asked by deputy insolvency and companies court judge Barnett what the outcome of Mallyaâs extradition proceedings were. Marshall replied: âThe extradition request was upheld. He is still here because there is another route. You can apply to the secretary of state for a status, meaning you wonât go back. This is a historic route.â He also said: âWere Mallya to leave the jurisdiction it would undermine the whole point of the bankruptcy proceedings and make it more difficult for the trustee to carry out enquiries and his resistance to extradition and costs incurred are beneficial to the estate.â It is widely thought that Tiger Hanif â accused of being the mastermind of the 1993 Surat bomb blasts â was granted asylum, which led to his extradition to India being reversed in 2019. He had exhausted all avenues of appeal in the UK courts in 2013 and was due to be extradited, but, like Mallya, never went back. A decision was later made by the home secretray to withdraw the order for his extradition. On September 11, 2020 the bankruptcy petitioners and Mallya entered into a consent order whereby the net proceeds of sale of property in France worth â¬3.27 million (about Rs 29 crore) â ultimately owned by Mallya â were paid into the court funds office. Mallya was seeking on Friday Â£2.79 million from that pot to pay for his bankruptcy legal fees in the UK and the legal fees of his extradition case â including the Crown Prosecution Service costs â as well as all his cases in India, and his monthly Â£22,500 (approximately Rs 22 lakh) living expenses for six months. The court heard he was seeking legal fees in India amounting to approximately Â£1.8 million (about Rs 18 crore). These include the fugitive economic offender proceedings brought by the Indian government, which he is challenging, as well as the 11% compound interest on the principal debt which he is challenging, and also his settlement proposal in the Supreme Court of India. He also sought Â£127,818 (about Rs 1.3 crore) to pay Boutique Law for legal fees in respect of his extradition proceedings. The court heard that the costs order against him to pay for the Crown Prosecution Service legal fees had already been paid as otherwise he would have been imprisoned. There are also fees in the Diageo case, the court heard. The court also heard that a close relative of Mallyaâs has recently died of Covid-19, inhibiting his ability to give instructions, and that he earns Â£5,000 (almost Rs 5 lakh) a month after losing his consultancy income of Â£62,500 (Rs 62 lakh) per month with the Racing Point F1 Team in October 2020. Apart from the sale of the French mansion he only has Â£250,000 (Rs 2.5 crore) in a bank account that is subject to a third party debt order. Tony Beswetherick, representing the banks, opposed his application on the basis it would totally deplete the funds held for the benefit of the creditors and on the basis that Mallya had other assets, namely two yachts in storage in Southampton, cars in storage in France, and almost Â£1.5 million (about Rs 15 crore) owed to him by various Mallya family trusts. The court heard that in addition to the petitionersâ debt, Mallya owes other creditors Â£2.5 million (Rs 25 crore) and has a further supporting creditor owed Â£2.3 million (about Rs 23 crore). Barnett reserved judgment.

KLINY, Czech Republic: In a dog training centre built inside a shipping container located in a Czech mountain village, Renda, Cap and Laky are being put to the test. They sniff at six vessels, each containing a piece of cloth with scent from patients with Covid-19, negative donors, or fake samples. "Good boy!" exclaims Lenka Vlachova, a trainer working at Prague's fire brigade, as jagdterrier Renda sits down by one sample, wagging his tail. The team of dog trainers are working in their own time and report a 95-percent success rate in Covid-19 detection in samples of human scent. "The study is designed to verify dogs' ability to detect Covid-19 and generate a method enabling the use of trained dogs in combatting the pandemic," project head Gustav Hotovy told AFP. "The method should also work with other diseases, even more lethal than Covid-19," Hotovy said. "In the end, we should be able to detect a huge number of people in a very short time with a trained dog," he said, speaking in the snowy village of Kliny near the German border. Vlachova told AFP the first study confirming dogs are able to detect tissue attacked by a virus was conducted in the United States about a decade ago. "The virus changes the human tissue, affecting the scent signature of the person," she said. Hotovy, a retired cynologist whose team started training the dogs last August, said that the signature changes "so much that it is immediately discernible for the dogs". The samples used are obtained merely by rubbing a piece of cotton against the patient's skin. The team then has to ensure the sample is virus-free to prevent the dogs from catching the disease. Using the same sampling method, a Finnish team has been using dogs for testing at Helsinki airport, reporting its dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy. Vlachova said the Czechs would like to work together with the Finns or with French and German teams working on similar projects. Unlike their western peers, the Czech team works in its free time and relies on scant financial means provided by a local dog food maker. Cynologist Katerina Jancarikova said the virus-affected tissue made up "just a tiny fragment in the overall scent, a part of the dogs' puzzle". "It's like looking for Wally," she said, referring to the popular children's books in which a tiny character in red and white stripes has to be found in pictures of a huge crowd. Jancarikova said any dog can be trained for detection as long as it is cooperative. As Vlachova led Renda back to the van, Hotovy walked into the training centre with a sturdy giant schnauzer named Laky who eagerly sniffed at the vessels, placed in a different pattern, before easily identifying the positive one. "He was once reluctant to cooperate," he chuckled, adding that the dogs showed the same eager response when let loose in a nearby house where a guest who tested positive for Covid-19 had been staying. "They immediately jumped at his bed with the same happy reaction they show over a positive sample in the centre," he said.

The flood of testimony under the social media hashtag #Metooinceste followed the early January publication of a book, "La familia grande", by Camille Kouchner. In it she accused her step-father, prominent political commentator Olivier Duhamel, of having abused her twin brother. Macron did not directly address that case. But in a short video posted to Twitter, he promised those speaking out online: "We are here. We're listening to you. We believe you. And you will never be alone again." And he added: "We have to adapt our laws to better protect child victims of incest and sexual violence." Promising to "punish criminals for their acts in the past and prevent them ever reoffending", Macron said the law would be updated. In 2018, France already pushed back the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against minors to 30 years. But some people have argued such acts should never fall beyond the reach of the justice system. "No-one can ignore these experiences any longer," Macron said. "We have to hear and gather victims' testimonies even years, decades afterwards."

PARIS: Portuguese voters have been asked to venture out despite the country's pandemic lockdown Sunday for a presidential election widely expected to see centre-right incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa win another term. Polls point to a first-round win for Rebelo de Sousa, a former political commentator turned approachable head of state known for candid moments like queueing at the supermarket in shorts, plunging into the sea to help girls whose canoe had capsized or sharing a meal with homeless people. But observers have their eye on how a far-right challenger will perform -- and whether a plunge in turnout could produce an upset. At stake is a post with the power to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections -- a pivotal constitutional role with a minority government in power. Portugal has been under a second national lockdown for the past 10 days aimed at braking a surge in coronavirus cases. The country recorded its worst daily coronavirus death toll and number of new infections on Saturday bringing fatalities to over 10,000. More than 80,000 infections were reported in the past week to Friday, the highest rate worldwide in proportion to its 10.8 million people, according to an AFP tally based on government figures. Almost every new day brings a fresh record in case numbers, and the government has now shut schools for two weeks on top of shops and restaurants. In his final campaign speech, Rebelo de Sousa -- one of the rare politicians often referred to simply by his first name -- urged voters to back him so as to avoid a second round. That would "spare the Portuguese people from the election being stretched out over three crucial weeks" -- time that could be better spent slowing the pandemic, the former minister and co-founder of the centre-right Social Democratic Party (PSD) said. "An abstention rate of 70 percent would be enough to make a second round almost unavoidable," the 72-year-old warned. Lower turnout could also upset the expected easy win for Rebelo de Sousa, with polls giving him 58 percent of the first-round vote -- far ahead of socialist challenger Ana Gomes and far-right populist Andre Ventura, on 15 and 10 percent. A first-round re-election would fit in with Portugal's experience since adopting democratic government in 1974, with all four of the president's predecessors securing a second five-year term this way. Nevertheless, in a long political career "I've seen more failures than victories, so I keep things in perspective", "Marcelo" said recently when asked if he hadn't been campaigning hard enough. "When I lost it wasn't the end of the world. And when I won, I didn't think I was the best." Rebelo de Sousa's popularity with voters has not suffered from his indulgence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa's socialist minority government. He is so well-liked that the socialist party didn't even bother putting up a candidate, denying its backing to 66-year-old Gomes, a former diplomat and European lawmaker turned anti-corruption activist. Meanwhile Ventura, the 38-year-old founder of right-wing populist party Chega -- "Enough" -- says he is in the running to "crush the Left", which is fielding three out of the seven candidates. Portugal has so far been largely spared the anti-establishment surges from the right that have reshaped the political landscape in many larger EU nations in recent years. Ventura secured his party's first and only parliamentary seat at 2019 legislative elections, winning the backing of 70,000 voters or 1.3 percent.

MOSCOW: Russian police arrested more than 3,000 people Saturday in nationwide protests demanding the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's most prominent foe, according to a group that counts political detentions. The protests in scores of cities in temperatures as low as minus-50 C (minus-58 F) highlighted how Navalny has built influence far beyond the political and cultural centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. In Moscow, an estimated 15,000 demonstrators gathered in and around Pushkin Square in the city center, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were roughly dragged off by helmeted riot officers to police buses and detention trucks. Some were beaten with batons. Navalny's wife Yulia was among those arrested. Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about a kilometer (half-mile) away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing. Some later went to protest near the jail where Navalny is held. Police made an undetermined number of arrests there. The protests stretched across Russia's vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus-50 Celsius, to Russia's more populous European cities. Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media. ``The situation is getting worse and worse, it's total lawlessness,`` said Andrei Gorkyov, a protester in Moscow. ``And if we stay silent, it will go on forever.'' The OVD-Info group, which monitors political arrests, said at least 1,167 people were detained in Moscow and more than 460 at another large demonstration in St. Petersburg. Overall, it said 3,068 people had been arrested in some 90 cities, revising the count downward from its earlier report of 3,445. The group did not give an explanation for its revision. Russian police did not provide arrest figures. Undeterred, Navalny's supporters called for protests again next weekend. Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and which Russian authorities deny. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges. The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin's government. His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind _ officials are apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free, but keeping him in custody risks more protests and criticism from the West. In a statement, the U.S. State Department condemned ``the use of harsh tactics against protesters and journalists this weekend in cities throughout Russia'' and called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny and all those detained at protests. Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering _ which Navalny says was politically motivated _ is converted to 3 1/2 years behind bars. Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days. Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned. Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake. Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repressions. He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.

WUHAN: The Chinese city of Wuhan marked one year since the start of its traumatic 76-day coronavirus lockdown Saturday, while the pandemic raged elsewhere and governments scrambled to put in place new measures. Europe faced a worsening struggle with production woes hitting supply of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine as well as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot. Around the world, more than 2.1 million people have died of Covid-19 since it emerged in China in December 2019, with over 98 million infected. In the world's worst-hit country, US President Joe Biden warned America's death toll could pass 600,000, the highest estimate yet that would mark a devastating rise on the 400,000 fatalities so far. But the picture was vastly different in Wuhan, where humming traffic, bustling sidewalks, and citizens packing parks and public transport underscored the scale of the recovery in the metropolis of 11 million where the pathogen first emerged before going global. "I think Wuhan is quite safe now, safer than my hometown and most places in China," 21-year-old resident Wang Yizhe said. Elsewhere in China, new outbreaks have prompted harsh responses. Thousands of Hong Kongers in Jordan, one of the city's poorest and most densely-packed districts, were ordered to stay home Saturday unless they can show a negative test, in the city's first lockdown. AstraZeneca told AFP late Friday that "lower yield" at one of its vaccine-making sites would affect deliveries across Europe. Lithuania estimated it would receive 80 percent fewer AstraZeneca doses than hoped in the first quarter, although German and French ministers tried to reassure the public of a steady supply. Deliveries of Pfizer-made shots to the continent's countries are already behind schedule as the US firm upgrades capacity at a Belgian plant. At a meeting with AstraZeneca representatives, the EU Commission "insisted on a precise delivery schedule on the basis of which member states should be planning their vaccination programs", Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted. Already cleared for use in Britain, EU authorities are expected to give the vaccine the green light at the end of January. On Friday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was "some evidence" the new strain first detected in the country "may be associated with a higher degree of mortality" as well as being more infectious. At 95,981 as of Friday, the UK death toll is the highest in Europe. The World Health Organization reassured that fabric masks should still work in hindering the spread of new variants from Britain, South Africa and Brazil. However, Norwegian capital Oslo toughened health restrictions after the British variant was found in a retirement home, closing all but essential shops and asking people to restrict movements. A French government source told AFP a new lockdown in the country looked increasingly likely with the more transmissible strain. Meanwhile the Netherlands introduced its first curfew since World War II, from 9 pm until 4:30am. Across the Atlantic, newly-installed President Biden stepped up federal aid even as he gave his highest estimate yet of the eventual toll. "The virus is surging," he said. "We're at 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000." And in the Colombian capital of Bogota, residents were under their third weekend quarantine in a row, meaning the closure of all non-essential shops in the city of eight million from Friday at 8 pm until Monday at 4 am. In Mexico, where hospitals have been overwhelmed and over 146,000 have died, people are queueing for hours to buy oxygen to care for the growing numbers fighting coronavirus at home. Brazilian scientists have meanwhile warned that the country faces running out of vaccine doses and basic equipment like syringes, just as its vaccination campaign gets underway -- with some blaming government for the shortages. In Wuhan, a team of World Health Organization experts was still in hotel quarantine ahead of a mission to investigate the source of the virus. "All hypotheses are on the table," WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference in Geneva. "And it is definitely too early to come to a conclusion of exactly where this virus started, either within or without China." But there was good news Friday for poorer nations, as the WHO and pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer announced a deal for up to 40 million initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be made available to them through the Covax global pool. A separate deal, brokered by international agencies working with the WHO, will supply developing nations with tens of millions of rapid antigen tests at half the usual $5 price.

HONG KONG: Thousands of Hong Kongers were ordered to stay in their homes on Saturday for the city's first coronavirus lockdown as authorities battle an outbreak in one of its poorest and most densely packed districts. The order bans about 10,000 people living inside multiple housing blocks within the neighbourhood of Jordan from leaving their apartment until all members in the area have undergone testing and the results are mostly ascertained. Officials said they planned to test everyone inside the designated zone within 48 hours "in order to achieve the goal of zero cases in the district". "Residents will have to stay at their premises to avoid cross-infection until they get their test results," health minister Sophia Chan told reporters on Saturday. The government had deployed more than 3,000 staff to enforce the lockdown, which covers about 150 housing blocks. Residents were seen lining up for testing at 51 mobile specimen collection vehicles parked in the area and for basic daily supplies provided by the government. Hong Kong was one of the first places to be struck by the coronavirus after it spilled out of central China. It has kept infections below 10,000 with some 170 deaths by imposing effective but economically punishing social distancing measures for much of the last year. Over the last two months the city has been hit by a fourth wave of infections, with authorities struggling to bring the daily numbers down. Stubborn clusters have emerged in low-income neighbourhoods notorious for some of the world's most cramped housing. The district of Jordan recorded 162 confirmed cases from the beginning of this year to January 20. On Friday, the city recorded 61 infections, of which 24 were from Yau Tsim Mong area where the restricted district is located. On paper Hong Kong is one of the richest cities in the world. But it suffers from pervasive inequality, an acute housing shortage and eye-watering rents that successive governments have failed to solve. The average flat in Hong Kong is about 500 square feet (46 square metres). But many squeeze themselves into even smaller subdivided flats -- cubicles that can be as tiny as 50 square feet or even less, with shared bathrooms and showers inside ageing walk-up buildings. It is in these kinds of buildings where clusters have been located in recent weeks, prompting the first lockdown order. In recent days health officials began carrying out mandatory testing in about 70 buildings in the area, but the government has now decided to test everyone so as to "break the transmission chain". The lockdown has created considerable confusion for residents. The looming restrictions were leaked to the city's local media on Friday but there was no official statement from the government until Saturday morning once the lockdown had come in overnight. Some media reported seeing residents leave the area ahead of the midnight deadline while others said locals were frustrated by the lack of clear information. Authorities said people who were not in the restricted area at the time but had stayed in it for more than two hours in the past 14 days must undergo compulsory testing before midnight today. The area is also home to many ethnic minorities, mainly South Asian Hong Kongers, a community that often faces discrimination and poverty. Earlier in the week a senior health official sparked anger when he suggested ethnic minority residents might be spreading the virus more readily because "they like to share food, smoke, drink alcohol and chat together". Critics countered that poverty and a lack of affordable housing forcing people to live in cramped conditions were to blame for the virus spreading more easily in those districts -- not race or culture. The health official's remarks also came as a video of predominantly white migrants dancing at a packed brunch on the more affluent Hong Kong Island sparked anger but no admonition from officials.

The talks would be held in Moldo opposite the Chushul sector in India, officials added. The last round of Corps Commander-level talks between both countries was held on November 6 in Chushul in Eastern Ladakh. India and China have been locked in a bitter standoff along the LAC for more than six months. While China began amassing massive military strength along the LAC, India responded with a befitting build-up. On August 29-30, India occupied heights along the northern and southern bank of the Pangong Lake which includes dominating positions overlooking the Chinese military deployed in that area. The Chinese have been asking India to withdraw troops and tanks first from the southern bank but India has been asking for disengagement from all the friction points.

TEHRAN: Iran's supreme leader's office has posted a photomontage of former US president Donald Trump playing golf under the shadow of a warplane alongside a pledge to avenge a deadly 2020 drone strike he ordered. The post on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's @khamenei_site Twitter account late Thursday warned there was no escape from payback for the US strike outside Baghdad airport which killed Iran's storied foreign operations chief General Qasem Soleimani and his Iraqi lieutenant. "Revenge is inevitable. Soleimani's killer and the man who gave the orders must face vengeance," it said. "Revenge can take place at any moment." Trump left office on Wednesday and flew straight to his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, without attending the inauguration of his successor President Joe Biden. Iranian officials have pledged repeatedly that Soleimani will be avenged. Earlier this month, on the first anniversary of his killing, judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi warned that not even Trump was "immune from justice" and that Soleimani's killers would "not be safe anywhere in the world".

Saudi Arabia redefines role as worldâs defender of Muslims

RIYADH: When Chinese diplomat Tan Banglin defended his countryâs treatment of Muslims amid an international outcry, his comments were less remarkable than where he made them. In a column last July for one of the most widely read newspapers in Saudi Arabiaâthe traditional protector of Muslims worldwideâTan talked about how the Communist Party had united with people in Xinjiang province, leading to âgreatâ changes. Thatâs as nations including the US were accusing China of putting Uighurs into detention camps. The voice given to Chinaâs consul general in Jeddah, less than 70 kilometers from Islamâs holiest city of Mecca, reflects the new political reckoning under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as he prioritizes more secular national interests at a critical juncture for the kingdom. And itâs one that may serve him well as the administration changes in Washington, despite US opposition to Beijingâs actions in Xinjiang. The Saudi world view is being shaped more by hard-nosed business calculations, shifting geopolitical realities and the emergence of clean energy as a competitor to oil while facing a challenge from Turkey for leadership of the Sunni Muslim sphere. The kingdom has been less vocal on the Palestinian issue, which for decades was its cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre. Saudi support for the Muslim population has been conspicuous by its absence in Kashmir, with the Pakistan government turning to Turkey while Prince Mohammed increases trade with India. âSaudi Arabia suffered from transnational political Islamism where some of its citizens were among the first to travel to help fellow Muslims, but not much identify with their own national causes,â said Prince Abdullah bin Khaled, a Saudi academic. âA change of course was required and very much welcomed.â US President Joe Biden has vowed to treat Saudi Arabia as a pariah after four years of cozy relations with his predecessor, Donald Trump. Conversations on issues on human rights, its devastating war on Yemen and rivalry with Iran are likely to be uncomfortable when they eventually happen. There could also be more tension over the 2018 killing of critic and columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul after Bidenâs nominee for national intelligence director this week pledged to release a report on who was responsible for the murder. But retrenching from intervening abroad under the guise of supporting fellow Muslimsâlike Turkey is doingâmay score some points with the Biden administration, according to Emily Hawthorne, a Texas-based analyst with Stratfor, which advises clients on geopolitical risks. âSaudis might see that becoming more of an economically focused modernized nation as more important than continuing to always nurture that leadership role in the broader Muslim world,â said Hawthorne. âItâs a gamble, but it might turn out well for them in terms of earning Saudi Arabia some clout.â Until a few years ago, it would have been rare to see warm praise for a communist party in print in Saudi Arabia, not to mention one from the representative of a country thatâs been censured for its alleged persecution of Muslims. In the 1980s Saudis sent money, and later their sons, to Afghanistan to join the fight against Soviet occupation of that country. Saudi relations with China have strengthened beyond supplying oil. King Salman, who took the throne in 2015, and the crown prince have paid separate visits to Beijing. On his trip in 2019, the prince appeared to defend Chinaâs alleged repression of Muslims and signed a deal to build a $10 billion refining and petrochemicals complex. This month, Chinaâs Huawei launched its largest flagship store outside China in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Investment Minister Khalid AlFalih tweeted the news, saying he was âdelightedâ with the announcement. Itâs been a journey that started slowly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks by 19 hijackers, 15 of them Saudi, and accelerated under Prince Mohammed. Under pressure to curb extremists, Saudi Arabia waged a successful campaign against radicals in the 2000s. Significantly, the late King Abdullah made Saudi National Day on September 23 a holiday, angering radicals who believe Muslims should not be divided by borders. As he rose to power four years ago, Prince Mohammed curbed the influence of the powerful religious establishment, gave women more freedoms and allowed concerts and movie theaters. He also tightened control of how financial aid is distributed abroad, making it largely to governments rather than directly to Muslim groups. Alcohol, which the Koran forbids, remains banned. The change was not an abandonment of Muslim issues but rather âbalancing support for them with the imperatives, sensitivities and priorities of the state, knowing that different contexts dictate different realities,â said Prince Abdullah, the academic. Indeed, Saudi Arabia used to be the first country to be blamed for fueling Islamist terrorism. Yet following a series of gruesome attacks by jihadists in France last year, it was Turkey that French President Emmanuel Macron singled out as an instigator. Saudi Arabia will always have the physical claim to Islam. Prince Mohammed, through his actions and decisions, has made it clear that the kingdomâs duty is to care for the two holy mosques in Mecca and Madinah and make them accessible to Muslims worldwide. One of the goals of his plan to restructure the economy is expanding the two sites and increasing the number of pilgrims. At the same time, the leadership has signaled itâs not the kingdomâs duty to fix the problems of Muslims worldwide. When India revoked Article 370 granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, which also claims the region, had hoped that Saudi Arabia would galvanize Muslims around this issue. The kingdom, the biggest source of remittances into Pakistan and among its largest creditors, didnât. Instead, trade with India, which the kingdom sees as an important economic powerhouse, has thrived since then as Saudi Arabia seeks to deepen its foothold in that country. In the third quarter of 2020, India, along with Egypt, drove an increase in foreign investment in the kingdom, a key pillar of the crown princeâs economic diversification plan. In the meantime, Turkey has been boosting ties with Islamabad. Its foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, opened a new consulate in Pakistan this month, promised to send investors to explore opportunities and presided over the signing of agreements in the movie industry. Turkish-Pakistani relations are âunique and enviableâ Mujahid Anwar Khan, Pakistanâs chief of air staff, told Turkeyâs state-run Andalou Agency this month. He thanked the Turkish leadership for its âsupportive statementsâ on Kashmir. The Saudis may be losing the soft-power game to Turkey at the moment, said Hawthorne. âBut theyâre probably valuing other games.â âTurkey has economic limits as to how much it is willing to sacrifice its own economic interests in pursuit of gaining the soft power. This is never a zero sum game.â

BAGHDAD: Two men blew themselves up in a crowded Baghdad market on Thursday, killing at least 32 people in Iraqâs first big suicide bombing in three years, authorities said, describing it as a possible sign of the reactivation of Islamic State terror group. Health authorities said at least 110 people had been wounded. Major General Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, which includes an array of Iraqi forces, said the first suicide bomber cried out loudly that he was ill in the middle of the bustling market, prompting a crowd to gather around him â and thatâs when he detonated his explosive belt. The second detonated his belt shortly after, he said. âDaesh terrorist groups might be standing behind the attacks,â civil defence chief Major General Kadhim Salman said, using an Arabic acronym for IS. Thursdayâs attack took place in the same market that was struck in the last big attack, in January, 2018, when at least 27 people were killed. PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi held an urgent meeting with top security commanders to discuss the suicide attacks, the premierâs office said. Iraqi security forces were deployed and key roads blocked. Meanwhile, Pope Francis, who is due to visit Iraq in e arly March, denounced the attack as a âsenseless act of brutalityâ and urged Iraqis to keep working to replace violence with peace.

BAGHDAD: Twin suicide bombings ripped through a busy market in the Iraqi capital Thursday, killing at least 28 people and wounding 73 others, officials said. The rare suicide bombing attack hit the Bab al-Sharqi commercial area in central Baghdad amid heightened political tensions over planned early elections and a severe economic crisis. Blood smeared the floors of the busy market amid piles of clothes and shoes as survivors took stock of the disarray in the aftermath. No one immediately took responsibility for the attack. Iraq's military said at least 28 people were killed and 73 wounded in the attack and said some of the injured were in serious condition. Hospital and police officials said the death toll was actually much higher, with at least 27 dead and more than 60 wounded. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Iraq's health ministry announced all of its hospitals in the capital were mobilized to treat the wounded. The attack occurred as security forces pursued two suicide bombers who detonated their explosives in the market near Tayaran Square, according to military spokesman Yahya Rasool. The suicide bombings marked the first in three years to target Baghdad's bustling commercial area. A suicide bomb attack took place in the same area in 2018 shortly after then-Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State group. No one immediately took responsibility for Thursday's attack, but Iraq has seen assaults perpetrated by both the Islamic State group and militia groups in recent months. Militias have routinely targeted the American presence in Iraq with rocket and mortar attacks, especially the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The pace of those attacks, however, has decreased since an informal truce was declared by Iran-backed armed groups in October. The style of Thursday's assault was similar to those IS has conducted in the past. But the group has rarely been able to penetrate the capital since being dislodged by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition in 2017. The twin bombings Thursday came days after Iraq's government unanimously agreed to hold early elections in October. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had announced in July that early polls would be held to meet the demands of anti-government protesters. Demonstrators took to the streets in the tens of thousands last year to demand political change, and an end to rampant corruption and poor services. More than 500 people were killed in mass demonstrations as security forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse crowds. Iraq is also grappling with a severe economic crisis brought on by low oil prices that has led the government to borrow internally and risk depleting its foreign currency reserves.

BRASILIA: Brazil's newly launched vaccination campaign against Covid-19 has gotten off to a late and rocky start -- as the country is hammered by a second wave of the disease, it is already close to running out of vaccine, syringes and other vital equipment, according to scientists who blame the government of Jair Bolsonaro. The campaign only began on Monday in the country of 212 million, weeks after the United States and European countries launched their vaccination programs. The late rollout, hampered by short supplies, has sparked growing public ire, with widespread complaints about people being vaccinated out of turn. Thousands of people in several cities mounted protests this weekend demanding Bolsonaro's ouster. The inoculation drive so far involves six million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine from China's Sinovac, and two million of the British AstraZeneca-Oxford jab, which arrived Friday after several delays from India where they are made. The Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo, associated with Sinovac, has also received authorization for another 4.8 million doses of CoronaVac. But no sooner had the vaccination program begun than professionals sounded the alarm about delays. This comes at a time when the pandemic has been surging, claiming more than 1,000 lives a day and more than 215,000 to date, second only to the US total of over 415,000. Any interruption in the supply chain could bring the vaccination program to a sudden halt, according to Isabella Ballalai, vice president of the Brazilian Society for Immunology (SBIM). She denounced what she called "the incompetence of the Health Ministry" and said greater transparency is needed to restore public confidence. Bolsonaro, who has long played down the seriousness of Covid-19, on Friday cast doubt on the effectiveness of vaccines. The government acknowledged this month that it lacked 30 million syringes for the first phase of its national plan, which aims -- over an unclear timeline -- to immunize 50 million people. On top of the distribution challenges in this vast country, complaints have arisen in several cities about people getting vaccinated even when not in a priority group. In Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, where hospitals are overflowing with Covid patients and oxygen supplies are critically short, the outcry of complaints led to a 24-hour suspension of vaccinations. The Butantan Institute has said it expects eventually to be able to produce 40 million doses of the CoronaVac; the Fiocruz foundation, which has links to the Health Ministry, is supposed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine but has warned of supply chain problems. Many experts attribute the delays to Bolsonaro's frequent criticism of the CoronaVac vaccine, which they say has offended the Chinese. The only explanation, said Margareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist and researcher at Fiocruz, is "absolute negligence, the diplomatic incompetence of Brazil." Bolsonaro on Thursday rejected such criticism, saying the problem "is bureaucratic and not political." Thomaz Favaro, a political analyst with Control Risks, pointed a finger at the government, which he said "delayed in signing agreements with the laboratories." Brazil has yet to reach agreement to purchase either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Janssen vaccine. But Favaro said Bolsonaro will eventually have to pay a political price, adding, "the delay in the vaccination campaign has a serious impact on economic recovery, and that will increase people's frustration." A new poll Friday showed Bolsonaro's popularity is at its lowest point -- 31 percent -- since he came to office in January 2019.

CARACAS: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Saturday he was willing to "turn the page" with the US under President Joe Biden, calling for a "new path" after years of tension with Donald Trump's White House. "We are willing to walk a new path in our relations with Joe Biden's government based on mutual respect, dialogue, communication and understanding," the leftist leader told supporters, adding that he "is willing to turn the page" with the new US administration. Trump's government had slapped multiple economic sanctions on Venezuela, including an oil embargo in place since 2019, in an attempt to overthrow the socialist regime of Maduro, whom the US has labeled a dictator. After years of a frosty relationship Caracas and Washington fully broke diplomatic ties on January 23, 2019, when the US government recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. After Biden won the US presidential election in November, Maduro congratulated the longtime politician, saying Venezuela was "ready for dialogue and good understanding with the people and government of the United States," repeating those sentiments again in December. Analysts believe the Biden administration will take a more moderate stance on Venezuela and will support international mediation for the transition towards a new government. That said, Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, has already described Maduro as a "brutal dictator," and during his Senate confirmation hearing said he supported Trump's policy of backing Guaido. The renewed support for Guaido follows the swearing in of a new pro-Maduro Venezuelan National Assembly following December elections boycotted by the opposition, who claimed fraud. The new parliament technically left Guaido, the chamber's former speaker, without a job, although he plans to maintain a parallel body of shadow opposition lawmakers that has gained foreign backing. According to the UN, more than five million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015, fleeing political and economic turmoil.

YANGON: Hammering at bamboo poles to erect a stilt house, minority Christians who have fled conflict in northern Myanmar are building a sanctuary on the outskirts of Yangon. The small Christian community in the Buddhist-majority nation is part of 200,000 people displaced since 2018 by fierce fighting in northern Rakhine state. The conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army, a militant group agitating for more autonomy for ethnic Rakhine people, has left hundreds dead or injured. It has spilled over into neighbouring Chin state, forcing ethnic Chin, who are predominantly Christian, out of their villages and into temporary camps. "We were the hosts of this war from two sides and we saw a lot of trouble," says Kan Lwat, who remembers artillery shelling on his town in Chin state. The 36-year-old is the leader of about 80 Chin people who travelled more than 600 kilometres (370 miles) from the remote town of Paletwa to Myanmar's sprawling commercial capital, where they spent brief stints in temporary camps. They settled last month on a small plot of land in Yangon's Hmawbi Township and decided to christen their village Baythala -- or "Bethel" -- the biblical town that served as a refuge for those in need, says Kan Lwat. "It means Jesus was blessing and helping people in trouble with this place, which will be peaceful." At Baythala, the villagers bathe outdoors, splashing themselves with water stored in large urns, while children play nearby and women prepare dinner as the sun sets. There is no water supply or electricity yet, says Kan Lwat, and building new homes has taken longer than expected as they wait for donations to buy the materials. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed once-bustling Yangon into an economic slump, making it difficult for the Chin migrants to find work. "We have no jobs right now," the village leader says, adding that their food supplies are donated from Christian organisations and Chin rights groups. Despite their troubles, having a safe place without the daily fear of artillery shelling or soldiers encroaching on their village is a godsend, says pastor Aung Far. "Even if we wanted to go home, we can't live in peace because there's still fighting," the pastor says. As she chops cucumbers in preparation for dinner, Hla Sein watches men hammering bamboo poles together to make a nearby house. "I hope to stay in my own house in this village forever," says the 35-year-old. "I feel happy living here. It's a different feeling (than) in my home village." Kan Lwat is hopeful that once the pandemic eases, and the adults find employment, 30 or so children in the village will have access to better education. "Even if our lives are not good, I hope my children will have a brighter future ahead," he says.

NEW DELHI: World Health Organisation (WHO) director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Saturday lauded India and PM Narendra Modi for the countryâs support to the global Covid-19 response. âThank you India and PM Narendra Modi for your continued support to the global Covid-19 response. Only if we #ACTogether, including sharing of knowledge, can we stop this virus and save lives and livelihoods,â Tedros said in a tweet. India has supplied Covid-19 vaccines to 13 foreign countries, including its neighbours like Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The government has also conducted training of immunisation programme managers using Indian vaccines covering all aspects of vaccine rollout. On Friday, the United States also applauded India for gifting Covid-19 vaccines to several countries, saying New Delhi is a âtrue friendâ which is using its pharma industry to help the global community. Brazilian President Jair M Bolsonaro also took to his official Twitter handle to thank PM Modi for vaccine supplies. Bolsonaro tweeted, âBrazil feels honoured to have a great partner to overcome a global obstacle by joining efforts. Thank you for assisting us with the vaccine exports from India to Brazil. Dhanyavaadâ India, which is a major supplier of medicines and pharmaceutical products to the world has played a significant role even during Covid-19.

$1B Mega Millions prize a result of long odds, slow sales

DES MOINES: The jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery game has grown to $1 billion ahead of Friday night's drawing after more than four months without a winner thanks to bad luck, poor odds and reduced play partially blamed on the coronavirus pandemic. It's only the third time a lottery jackpot has grown so large, but much has changed since the last time such a big prize was up for grabs in 2018. The odds of winning a jackpot remain the same _ incredibly small _ but for a variety of reasons fewer people are playing Mega Millions or Powerball, the two lottery games offered in most of the country. And even as the huge Mega Millions prize and a $731.1 million Powerball jackpot won Wednesday by a single ticket sold in Maryland have juiced sales for the games, Maryland lottery director Gordon Medenica noted: ``We're not out of the woods yet.'' Medenica acknowledged sales were dramatically lower before the pandemic, and they tanked even further in the spring and summer. After a peak in October 2018, Medenica said sales of the big lottery games dropped about 50%, prompting talk among lottery officials about jackpot fatigue. Sales of Mega Millions and Powerball continued to decline after the virus hit along with other lottery games, but while scratch tickets and other instant games rebounded strongly later in the year, national game sales remained moribund. In response to falling sales, officials updated the national games to reduce starting jackpots from $40 million to $20 million and changed rules about guaranteed minimum increases between drawings. The moves made fiscal sense but they caused jackpots to grow more slowly, further tamping down sales, as demonstrated by the record 37 draws without a winner it took to reach the current Mega Millions jackpot that's still far less than the all-time highs. ``That's why it takes so many rolls to get up to a high jackpot level,'' Medenica said. What hasn't changed are the odds. By design, Mega Millions and Powerball are relatively generous in awarding small dollar prizes and lottery officials boast there is a roughly one in 24 chance of winning something. But to generate huge jackpots, officials must be absolutely miserly about paying jackpots. It's hard to fathom how unlikely it is to beat odds of one in 292.2 million for Powerball or one in 302.5 million for Mega Millions. To get a sense of your chances, Steven Bleiler, a mathematics and statistics professor at Portland State University, said people should imagine a swimming pool 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide, 120 feet (36.6 meters) long and 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep, filled to the brim with M&Ms, only one of which is green. To win, all a player must do is jump in blindfolded and wade around until finding that single green candy. Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, put it this way: Your chances of picking up two oysters and finding a pearl in both is about twice as likely as winning either lottery jackpot. Still, someone always ultimately wins, and it happened again after Wednesday night's Powerball drawing when a single ticket sold at a convenience store in the small community of Lonaconing, Maryland, hit all six numbers. The winner can take a $716.3 annuity paid over 30 years or a cash prize of $546.8 million. What comes next is unclear. Some states are banking on growth in online games, but while the 10 states that allow purchases on computers and phone apps are seeing rising sales, such purchases remain a relatively small percentage of overall revenue. ``The current roll has revived the game as it's been designed,'' Medenica said. ``Whether we continue to consider making changes or not is to be seen.''

A law to crow about: France upholds rural 'sensory heritage'

PARIS: From crowing roosters to the whiff of barnyard animals, the "sensory heritage" of France's countryside will now be protected by law from attempts to stifle the everyday aspects of rural life from newcomers looking for peace and quiet. French senators on Thursday gave final approval to a law proposed in the wake of several high-profile conflicts by village residents and vacationers, or recent arrivals derided as "neo-rurals". A rowdy rooster named Maurice in particular made headlines in 2019 after a court in western France rejected a bid to have him silenced by neighbours who had purchased a holiday home nearby. "Living in the countryside implies accepting some nuisances," Joel Giraud, the government's minister in charge of rural life, told lawmakers. Cow bells (and cow droppings), grasshopper chirps and noisy early-morning tractors are also now considered part of France's natural heritage that will be codified in its environmental legislation. "It sends a strong message," said Pierre-Antoine Levi, the senator who acted as rapporteur for the bill. "It can act as a useful tool for local officials as they carry out their educational and mediation duties," he said. The law is emblematic of growing tensions in the countryside between longtime residents and outsiders whose bucolic expectations often clash with everyday realities. Corinne Fesseau and her rooster Maurice became the image of the fight when she was brought to court by pensioners next door over the animal's shrill wake-up calls. Critics saw the lawsuit as part of a broader threat to France's hallowed rural heritage by outsiders and city dwellers unable or unwilling to understand the realities of country life. Thousands of people signed a "Save Maurice" petition, and a judge eventually upheld the cock-a-doodle-doos. In another case from 2019, a woman in the duck-breeding heartland of the Landes region was brought to court by a newcomer neighbour fed up with the babbling of the ducks and geese in her back garden. A court in southwest France also threw out that case.

PARIS: Frenchwoman Jeanne Pouchain has an unusual problem. Sheâs officially dead. She has been trying for three years to prove that she is alive. The 58-year-old woman says she lives in constant fear, not daring to leave her house in the village of Saint Joseph, in the Loire region. Authorities seized her car over an unpaid debt she contests and which is at the center of her troubles. She fears the family furniture will be next. Pouchainâs status has prevented her and her husband, who is her legal beneficiary along with her son, from using their joint bank account. Being declared deceased has deprived her of other critical amenities. Pouchainâs status as deceased is the result of a 2017 Lyon court decision that deemed her dead even though no death certificate was produced. The decision came at the end of a legal dispute with an employee of Pouchainâs former cleaning company, who was seeking compensation after losing her job 20 years ago. According to Pouchain and her attorney, snowballing judicial errors ended with the 2017 ruling by the Appeals Court of Lyon that Pouchain was not among the living. The legal imbroglio is all the stranger because, Pouchain contended, neither she nor her relatives got summons for the hearing. Cormier, her attorney, filed an unusual motion last Monday to invalidate the 2017 decision by the Lyon appeals court due to a âgrave errorâ by the judges. He said he has never before dealt with such a âcrazyâ case.

FAIR HAVEN: A goat and a dog who were each elected mayor have helped raise money to renovate a Vermont community playground. The oddball idea of pet mayor elections to raise money to rehabilitate the playground and to help get local kids civically involved came from a local town manager. In 2018, Fair Haven residents elected Lincoln the goat as its honorary mayor. Lincoln helped raise about $10,000 while the current mayor, Murfee, a Cavalier King Charles spaniel, has raised $20,000, Town Manager Joe Gunter told the Rutland Herald. The town chipped in another $20,000. Murfee's owner, Linda Barker, said that when she was talked into having Murfee get involved in politics, she thought it would be easy to raise money through T-shirts. Then the pandemic struck. So she shifted to masks. She's made nearly 1,000 of them, and will be making another round of them for Valentine's Day. She raised more than $5,000 from the masks and a similar amount from basket raffles. The town was also recently awarded a $50,000 grant from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, she said. Ironically, the honorary mayor is not welcome on the playground. Barker said there's a "no dogs allowed" sign. âMurfee is going to take that up with the town,â Barker said Sunday with a chuckle. âHe's going to contest that.â
