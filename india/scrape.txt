BENGALURU: Dr AP Nirmal Raj, a professor of dental sciences from Bengaluru who works in Uttar Pradesh, is among lakhs of Indians who have received the Covid vaccine so far. But he is not just a medical professional whose inoculation inspires public confidence: the 47-year-old has undergone kidney transplant twice and says the related comorbidities he suffers from didnât stop him. âAs a dentist, there is risk of Covid infection as we deal with saliva and aerosols during dental procedures and hence it is better to be protected,â said Nirmal. âIn addition, with me being a kidney recipient twice, and on immunosuppressant medication, Iâm even more vulnerable. I consulted doctors and they said the Covid vaccine does not interfere with the drugs that I am on. Covid is here to stay and the vaccine is a necessity.â Amid efficacy row, Covaxin gets thumbs-up from LancetNirmal heads the department of prosthodontics at Theerthankar Mahaveer Dental College and Research Centre in Moradabad. He took the vaccine on January 16, the day the nationwide drive was launched. Vaccination drive: Fewer takers for Covaxin among healthcare workersNirmal underwent the first kidney transplant in 2008 and his mother was the donor. In 2014, symptoms of renal failure resurfaced. From 2015 to 2018, he was on dialysis and in March 2018, he underwent kidney transplant for the second time, through a cadaver donor. Vaccine hesitancy amongst UKâs South Asian diaspora a worryLike all others, Nirmal admits, he too initially had doubts about taking the vaccine. âI went ahead with the vaccination after thorough consultation with experts in the field. The vaccine does not interfere with the medicines renal patients like me take and does not aggravate comorbidities,â said Nirmal, adding that he has not experienced any side-effects so far. Nirmalâs talk post-vaccination is now getting traction on social media pages. âDr Nirmal taking the vaccine is an encouragement for many,â said Sundar. Delhi reports 86% turnout as vaccine acceptance growsNirmal said the perception among kidney patients and organ recipients who have not been infected is that they are safe and it is better without the vaccine. âDuring the lockdown, when several parts of India reported increasing Covid cases, everyone was at home. But now, everyone is out for work or studies. Thatâs why there is a need to take the vaccine and be safe,â he explained. Most dialysis patients are on heparin, an anticoagulatory drug, and caution needs to be taken, said Sundar. âHeparin must be avoided a day prior to the vaccination, on the day of vaccination and a day after that. So, for three days in all. Those who are on heparin should avoid any intramuscular injection on the days of dialysis, not just Covid vaccine. Any kidney patient must consult their doctor before going for Covid vaccination.â

BENGALURU: What do you do when work from home gets monotonous and taxing? If you happen to be Bakcen George, Allwyn Joseph or Ratish Bhalerao, chances are that you would be logging in to your workstation from a highway dhaba. When Covid-induced work from home got boring, the three friends took off on their cycles, pedalling over 1,600km across three states. They never missed out on office duties along the way. For George, 37, a digital marketing executive and adventure buff from Thane, the lockdown was trying. âI was slipping into depression and the dream of cycling from Mumbai to Kanyakumari was constantly on my mind. I knew I wasnât going to get 20 days leave to travel, so I thought why not work from a highway instead,â he said. On 19 November, George told childhood pals Joseph (37) and Bhalerao (36) of his plan. Both Joseph and Bhalerao, who didnât even own bicycles, decided to join him. âIt sounded very adventurous and clearly a change from the routine,â laughed Allwyn Joseph, an executive with a Mumbai-based logistics firm, who bought a second-hand cycle for the trip. Bhalerao had quit his job but was engaged in freelance online work. They began their trip from Kalyan on November 21, armed with a plan to pedal along the coast till Kanyakumari, Tamil Nadu. âWe would ride from 4am to 11am and halt at dhabas or teashops to open our laptops and finish office work,â George said. They reached Kanyakumari on December 14.

She is an atrocious sous chef, an aggravating driver and an annoying early riser. He is obsessed with his hair, a keen sniffer of symbolism in movies and a kitchen diva who likes lemons cut âlongitudinallyâ. If not for Covid-19, Vijeeta Balasundaram and her husband Viswanath Ravi would hardly have been as fluent in each otherâs private insanities, her plum job with a financial MNC in Mumbai and later Hyderabad and his e-commerce operations manager title in Chennai confining their nascent marriage to rote video calls, texts and weekend meetings. Over the last eleven months spent snoozing alarms, watching movies, and working out alongside each other, the lovebirds have learnt the golden rule of a successful roommate agreement: âBe flexible.â Reunited suddenly by work from home, unlock, job loss and other side-effects of Covid-19, long-distance marriages are waking up to the joys and torments of cohabitation. Propelled into proximity after being separated by livelihood, some couples are redrawing domestic budgets and some, domestic boundaries. Though Vijeeta and Viswanath had planned to move into a new home in Hyderabad after their wedding in 2019, it was when her hostel in Hyderabad asked her to pack her bags due to the looming Covid threat in March that she shifted into her husbandâs maternal home in Chennai. Here he taught her to ride the two-wheeler through gritted teeth and tried not to laugh when she peeled onions without cutting off their roots while she watched him grow a pony tail and snore through alarms. Soon, their relationship matured past its first fights, flights and festivities. She still picks out the wrong utensils and he still watches fruit-slicing videos but the give and take is smoother. For Maithili Sonar, a product designer from Mumbai who moved into her husband Jigar Chavdaâs maternal home in Nashik in March last year thanks to the lockdown, the last ten months have been a roller coaster of emotions. Besides the fact that her husband spends an unnerving amount of time thinking about meals, Sonar, a fastidious planner, realised sheâd never be able to work with him. âHeâs too laidback,â she says. These days, when he leaves for office even though he can very well work from home, Maithili understands because once their lockdown staples of board games and impromptu jigs to Govinda numbers got old, the duo plunged into deep conversation mode. âEach of us realised there were issues in our personalities that we had to address and decided to seek therapy individually,â says Maithili, who feels the shared experience of witnessing loved ones die, divorce, get married and give birth, has made them a more sensitive team. Confronted with uncertainty and the economic crunch, some boomerang couples are recalibrating lifestyle choices. Earlier, whenever Goregaon-based techie Andrew and airline crew member Richa â spouses of three years â would get time with each other, their plans were hyper-caffeinated. But when the airline industry was hit severely by the pandemic and Richa returned to her in-lawâs home, they compensated for their lack of outdoor activities with things like cooking and painting. Separation weighed heavily on those with kids. Soft sobs ambush Pune-based software engineer Sujata Salviâs voice as she recalls the tyrannical initial phase of lockdown when her husband Tusharâs calm ear pulled her through her toughest multi-tasking gig: tending to her five-month-old baby with limited groceries, running the startup that she founded with her husband, finishing household chores and looking after the needs of her aging in-laws. Miles away in his workplace of 15 years in Qatar â whose borders were so tightly shut that he could neither fly down nor make video calls to family â Tushar would make up for his absence by not missing any calls from his wife . âIt feels like waking up from a bad dream,â says Tushar, who quit his overseas job as soon as the skies opened up in Qatar because âfamily is everythingâ. This is what I was really missing,â says Salvi, referring to the duo reacquainting themselves with their non-verbal shorthandâthe eye rolls and the cunning smiles that had eluded them for ten months. We agree on everything now,â says Sujata, about the co-owner of her startup and her life. âWe are one unit.â

NEW DELHI: As many as 1 lakh Central para-military personnel may be deployed in West Bengal for the upcoming assembly poll, surpassing the nearly 75,000-80,000 personnel that had stood guard during 2019 Lok Sabha polls in the state. Though the Election Commission and home ministry are yet to work out a balance between the Central forces required by EC and availability assessed by the home ministry, officials concerned did not rule out deployment of at least 1,000 companies of Central armed police forces (CAPFs), essentially CRPF, given the concerns regarding law and order as well as apprehensions of political violence among most opposition parties in West Bengal. âMore than 750 companies of Central forces were deployed during the last Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal. Since the upcoming polls are only in five states, unlike the countrywide parliamentary poll, the availability of forces is bound to be more,â an EC functionary said without elaborating on the extent of forces to be deployed this time. Assembly polls in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry are due to be held in April and shall wind up before the onset of CBSE board examinations on May 4. Sources in the Commission said EC may hold a fresh round of discussions with the home ministry after January 26 to finalise deployment details for West Bengal and Assam. Home ministry sources too indicated the requirement indicated by EC shall be adequately met. TOI has learnt that there are also some security-related concerns in Assam, where anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests have revived, and Kerala that is no stranger to violent clashes between cadres of various parties. During the ECâs just-concluded visit to Assam and West Bengal, most opposition parties expressed apprehensions about law and order as well as neutrality of the state police. The demand, particularly of BJP, was to let the Central para-military forces oversee poll security. On the other hand, the Trinamool Congress is said to have reassured EC regarding law and order situation in the state. Having heard both sides, the EC shall make its own neutral assessment of the law and order situation and monitor the same during polls by posting a special police observer in the state, as was done in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll. EC may go for the presence of Central para-military forces at 100% polling booths in West Bengal, as per a source. Special expenditure observers may be posted in Tamil Nadu, where large-scale illegal cash flow has marred several past polls. In Kerala, violent clashes between party cadres pose a concern. The full Commission plans to visit Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry soon to assess poll preparedness.

As India celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, far away in Malaysia, K R Somasundram nostalgically recalled how as a 14-year-old, he convinced INA officials that he was ready, fit and 16 years old, the minimum age required to join the Azad Hind Fauj. âPossibly my demeanour misled them, or my eagerness won them over,â chuckles Somasundaram, now 90, chairman of Malaysiaâs plantation workersâ cooperative, the National Land Finance Cooperative Society Limited (NLFCS). Somasundram wasnât the only one. Recruitment officers of the INA met hundreds of young boys and even girls from different parts of Malaya peninsula and the island of Singapore, eager to lay down their lives for Indiaâs freedom after listening to Netajiâs stirring speeches. Remembering one such speech at Singaporeâs Cathay Theatre, Somasundaram said, âSuch was the magnetism of Netajiâs words that more than 2,000 people, both soldiers and citizens, stood still in overwhelming silence for two hours before breaking into thunderous applause after his speech.â For Somasundram himself, his first brush with the fiery leader came about as a helper in a shop in his hometown. âWith the British retreating in 1942, our schools also closed and my father decided to send me to work at his friendâs shop. I heard inspiring stories of Indiaâs freedom struggle and also read them in newspapers.â âThe one thing that really built the Azad Hind Fauj and stands even today as a testimony to Netajiâs leadership is the training we received as army recruits,â added Somasundram. At the Azad School of Training, Somasundram underwent a 9-month course in guerilla warfare and jungle training, under former Indian Army officers who had joined the INA. âRoman Hindi was used in the INA and hence no language barriers existed; we were all one,â he said.

KOLKATA: Netaji Subhas Chandra Boseâs Germany-based daughter Anita B Pfaff chose his 125th birth anniversary on Saturday to paint the person behind the legend as "a devout Hindu", albeit one who was "tolerant towards all other religions". "He inspired his followers â members of the Indian National Army, his friends and his family â to respect other religions and yet be very religious himself," Pfaff said in a video message posted on the official Twitter handle of the Indian consulate general in Munich. Underlining the ideals of "unity and tolerance" that her father espoused all his life, Pfaff described him as "a man of thought and also of action". He envisaged an India that would be "modern, enlightened and, at the same time, deeply rooted in history, philosophy and religious traditions", she said. "I hope we can all take inspiration from Netajiâs ideas and ideals. I salute you in these efforts. Jai Hind." In Kolkata, Netaji Research Bureau chairman and former Trinamool MP Sugata Bose, who is one of Subhas Chandra Boseâs grandnephews, said it was more important to follow Netaji and Gandhijiâs ideals of uniting all castes and communities than giving his birth anniversary a particular tag. "What is important is not how we rename his birth anniversary...Personally, I am not too fond of the term Parakram Diwas. I much prefer Deshanayak Diwas," Sugata Bose said after seeing off PM Narendra Modi after his visit to Netajiâs Elgin Road residence.

BHUBANESHWAR/KONARK: Confined to her home for most part of the pandemic since March last year, when 70-year-old Savitri Rout finally got the opportunity to go for a weekend getaway with her children and grandchildren in January, the family chose an âeco retreatâ along the Chandrabhaga beach in Konark. Sitting with her granddaughter in the dining area and watching the high tide hit the shore, she said she was happy to be out again. Safety remains a prime concern for those willing to step out but travelling very far is still not on the minds of many. Those keen on a holiday are clearly looking for spaces that can be the âone-stop shopâ for all their vacation needs. Also, while protocols exist, implementation and compliance is what dominates conversations among tourists. Speaking to TOI, Odishaâs minister for tourism and culture Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi said, âThere is no doubt that the tourism sector is one of the worst hit by the pandemic, but it is also a fact that the revival of this sector is a key priority area for us. We also want tourism in Odisha to grow beyond religious tourism so that people experience our coastal belt.â An experiment to test the waters is underway through the eco retreat model in Konark and four other sites in Odisha. Offering tourists the option to stay in temporary luxury tent cottages, the âglampingâ retreats came up in December and despite the pandemic, they have logged over 60% occupancy. The state set up the first glamping eco retreat in Konark last year. (The writer was in Odisha at the invitation of the state government)

NEW DELHI: The punctuality of trains has leapfrogged from less than 75% in the past few years to 96-97% in recent months, though more freight trains are running this year. Currently almost 65% of mail express trains have resumed their services after these were disrupted during the pandemic. Top railway officials said even during the few days of heavy fog, the punctuality of trains this year was 90% as compared to around 60% in previous years. Officials said the improvement in punctuality on heavy foggy days has been possible as the national transporter has almost doubled the installation of âfog pass devicesâ on trains in the past two years. Out of the total 12,742 such on-board devices, nearly 3,000 have been deployed in trains running across the Northern Railways considering that the impact of fog is more in this part of the country. A total of 1,716 and 1,289 fog pass devices have been deployed in East Central Railway and North Central Railway respectively. Fog pass device is a GPS-based hand-held portable device which serves as an aid for the crew during foggy weather through audio visual alarm, whenever any landmark comes within the geo-fence range. âThis has not only improved punctuality but has also minimised chances of mishaps. Because of the audio alert in advance, the loco pilots can take the required measures,â said railway board CEO and chairman Suneet Sharma. Location of stations, warning boards, signals, level crossing gates and Whistle for Level crossing (W/L) boards in the section is fed in the equipment and it displays speed of the locomotive, distance and time to reach landmarks and is carried by the loco pilots. He added that the Indian Railways is hopeful of maintaining the improved punctuality even as it resumes operation of more trains. âA lot of efforts have been made to improve the capacity of our networks and more is being done. All issues get addressed when there is enough capacity in the system to meet the requirement,â Sharma said.
