BENGALURU: Dr AP Nirmal Raj, a professor of dental sciences from Bengaluru who works in Uttar Pradesh, is among lakhs of Indians who have received the Covid vaccine so far. But he is not just a medical professional whose inoculation inspires public confidence: the 47-year-old has undergone kidney transplant twice and says the related comorbidities he suffers from didnât stop him. âAs a dentist, there is risk of Covid infection as we deal with saliva and aerosols during dental procedures and hence it is better to be protected,â said Nirmal. âIn addition, with me being a kidney recipient twice, and on immunosuppressant medication, Iâm even more vulnerable. I consulted doctors and they said the Covid vaccine does not interfere with the drugs that I am on. Covid is here to stay and the vaccine is a necessity.â Amid efficacy row, Covaxin gets thumbs-up from LancetNirmal heads the department of prosthodontics at Theerthankar Mahaveer Dental College and Research Centre in Moradabad. He took the vaccine on January 16, the day the nationwide drive was launched. Vaccination drive: Fewer takers for Covaxin among healthcare workersNirmal underwent the first kidney transplant in 2008 and his mother was the donor. In 2014, symptoms of renal failure resurfaced. From 2015 to 2018, he was on dialysis and in March 2018, he underwent kidney transplant for the second time, through a cadaver donor. Vaccine hesitancy amongst UKâs South Asian diaspora a worryLike all others, Nirmal admits, he too initially had doubts about taking the vaccine. âI went ahead with the vaccination after thorough consultation with experts in the field. The vaccine does not interfere with the medicines renal patients like me take and does not aggravate comorbidities,â said Nirmal, adding that he has not experienced any side-effects so far. Nirmalâs talk post-vaccination is now getting traction on social media pages. âDr Nirmal taking the vaccine is an encouragement for many,â said Sundar. Delhi reports 86% turnout as vaccine acceptance growsNirmal said the perception among kidney patients and organ recipients who have not been infected is that they are safe and it is better without the vaccine. âDuring the lockdown, when several parts of India reported increasing Covid cases, everyone was at home. But now, everyone is out for work or studies. Thatâs why there is a need to take the vaccine and be safe,â he explained. Most dialysis patients are on heparin, an anticoagulatory drug, and caution needs to be taken, said Sundar. âHeparin must be avoided a day prior to the vaccination, on the day of vaccination and a day after that. So, for three days in all. Those who are on heparin should avoid any intramuscular injection on the days of dialysis, not just Covid vaccine. Any kidney patient must consult their doctor before going for Covid vaccination.â

CHANDIGARH: Unable to control the ever-increasing death rate, Punjab has decided to examine if a mutated coronavirus strain has entered the state, causing deaths at a higher rate. The state government has decided to send 5% of positive samples to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) for examination. In January, when rest of India saw a steady decline in the Covid-19 positivity rate and cases, Punjab continued to battle with a high death rate. The fatality rate in the state shot up while the positivity rate witnessed a dip from 2 % to 1% in the last 22 days and the R-value slipped as well, indicating a slower spread. According to sources, the government is looking to ascertain the reasons for high death rate despite taking all the corrective measures recommended by the state and central health experts. The data of the health department showed that the rate at which people succumbed to the virus from January 1-22 was 4.1% against the stateâs overall fatality rate of 3.2%. During this period, 194 people out of 4,752 infected by the virus died. So far, 5,543 people have lost their lives in the state. In the last 30 days, as many as six districts had death rate over 10%.

BENGALURU: The coverage data of Covid-19 vaccination in Karnataka has revealed that seven out of the nine serious instances of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were triggered by anxiety. The other two instances were cases of heart attack that resulted in death. The state health department has released the data. Adverse reactions are generally mild. But heightened concerns about potential side effects of the vaccine have pushed up anxiety levels among healthcare workers shortlisted for the first phase of inoculation. The seven who suffered serious AEFI in the form of anxiety are women aged between 32 and 47. All of them received a jab of Covishield. Six of them were hospitalised for a day. One, a 35-year-old nurse in Davanagere, is yet to be discharged. In most of the said cases, low blood pressure (hypotension) was noticed. âVaccine hesitancy needs to be addressed. Anyone can become anxious and this has been seen among some healthcare workers. Proper information about vaccination should be shared before the process,â said Dr Rajani K N, the state deputy director for immunisation. The topic of bouts of anxiety after vaccination is being discussed in meetings of the state health department and there are plans to implement a strategy to ease fears about inoculation.

NEW DELHI: Barring Kerala, Maharashtra and Nagaland, where the positivity rate was still in the red at 9.5%, 5% and 4.7% respectively over the last two 14-day periods (December 27-January 9 & January 9-22), the pandemic seems to be under control in other areas with 22 states and UTs bringing it down to below 1%. If the positivity rate, number of confirmed Covid cases per 100 tests, is above 5% measured over a 14-day period, the state is considered to be in the red zone and needs to impose lockdown in its containment zones. In Kerala, the positivity rate is still rising in contrast to the nationwide trend. Maharashtra, which has the countryâs highest 20 lakh confirmed cases so far and over 50,000 deaths due to the pandemic, has failed to bring down the positivity rate below 5%, except briefly during the December 13-26 fortnight when it was 4.78%. Since November, Keralaâs positivity rate has been above 9%, which is a matter of concern. The state alone added more than 70,000 cases in the last 14 days, more than Maharashtraâs 38,000. Goa took the second spot after Kerala till December last week in terms of the highest positivity rate. However, it has now brought it to a manageable limit of less than 4% in the fortnight ending January 22 while Chandigarh got to 3%. There are only four states with a positivity rate above 3%. Four other states/UTs have it between 2% and 3% while 22 others have 0.2% to 1.6%, an indication that herd immunity may have set in in these areas. Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Haryana, Odisha, Bihar have all brought it down to below 1% level in the last fortnight between January 9 and 22. Between November 8-21, there were nine states that had positivity rates between 7% and 15%. Leading the pack was Himachal Pradesh at 15%, followed by Delhi 13%, Rajasthan 11%, Haryana 10%, Kerala 10%, Goa 9%, West Bengal 8%, Maharashtra 8% and Chhattisgarh 7%.

NEW DELHI: The number of healthcare workers registering to take the vaccine showed a slow but inexorable rise on Saturday across Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkand. In Tamil Nadu, however, the number of people being inoculated against Covid-19 fell. The reasons for the rise were varying, from those emboldened by seeing senior doctors subject themselves to the first dose to a positive review in Lancetto news about recoveries among people who had reported adverse reactions and foreign demand for Indian-manufactured vaccines. A Lancet report has said Covaxin has proved safe and has produced an immune response in a small group of adults aged 18 to 55. Madhya Pradesh saw a rise in the vaccine curve, going by the turnout of the first four days. On day 1, January 16, just over 64% of the 15,000 intended beneficiaries had turned up. It shot up to 67.3%, and this led the authorities to increase the target for day 4, January 21, to 16,881. Though the overall vaccination rate in Bihar hovered about 50%, individual state government-run hospitals were showing an upward trend on Saturday with more and more healthcare workers stepping to be inoculated. For instance, Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) saw a 107% turnout on Saturday. âThankfully six beneficiaries who were supposed to take the shot on another day, voluntarily came forward to get the vaccine on Saturday,â Dr Bimal Karak, PMCH superintendent, said. He cited several reasons for this improvement, including the positive report on Covaxin appearing in the Lancet. Another factor was the coming forward of heads of hospitals and senior health department officials, which helped address the hesitancy among healthcare workers. In Jharkhand, too, the Lancet review and reports of foreign demand for the Indian-developed vaccine boosted confidence. Jharkhandâs vaccination drive nodal officer Dr Ajit Prasad said: âWe have reported a hike of around 8% in turnout as our coverage on Thursday touched 68% from an average of 60% reported last week. The reason behind the increase is the confidence developing among our healthcare workers after medical experts globally vouched for the efficacy of an Indian vaccine.â  Around 24,282 healthcare workers were inoculated in Maharashtra on Saturday, the fifth day of vaccinations in the state. It managed to cover 83% of the targeted number, up from 73% a day earlier. Maharashtra, in fact, recorded the highest turnout among the 27 states that had vaccination drives on Saturday. Mumbai managed its highest score so far, with 4,374 healthcare workers â 90% of the target â taking the vaccine.  In TN, a day after health minister Vijayabaskar, a doctor, took the indigenous Covaxin to motivate healthcare providers, the state reported a drop in the number of vaccinations to 7,575 (till 7 pm) from the 8,704 vaccinations it had reported by the same time on Friday and 9,277 on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Indiaâs daily Covid-19 case count stayed below 15,000 for the third day running but infections spiked to a 73-day high in Kerala, which accounted for 47% of the all cases detected in the country on Saturday. India recorded 14,891 fresh cases of the coronavirus, a marginal rise from the previous dayâs tally of 14,413.

Meanwhile, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases has fallen below the 14,000 mark, the lowest in seven months. The rolling average, which takes into account cases recorded over the past seven days, stood at 13,859 on Saturday. The last time the average daily count was below 14,000 was on June 21 last year. Maharashtra registered a slight dip in cases on Saturday, with 2,697 infections recorded in the state. The count on the previous day was 2,779.

The nationwide death toll from the virus has stayed at around the same level in the past five days. On Saturday, 155 fatalities were recorded. The count has remained between 150 and 160 since Tuesday, lower than the fatalities recorded in the previous week. Maharashtra again registered the highest number of deaths at 56, followed by Kerala (23). Delhi, Bengal and Punjab reported 10 deaths each.

NEW DELHI: Seven more states will be administering the indigenously-developed Covaxin from next week, the health ministry said on Saturday. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had earlier this month approved Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive. Addressing a media briefing, additional secretary in the Union health ministry Manohar Agnani said that as on January 23, a total of 15,37,190 beneficiaries have been vaccinated for Covid-19 in 27,776 sessions. The inoculation drive was launched on January 16 with over three crore healthcare and frontline workers prioritised to get the jabs initially. In addition to the 12 states currently using Covaxin, seven new states -- Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal -- will be administering the vaccine from next week, Agnani said. "The orientation of all programme managers of these seven states was conducted today by the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and the health ministry covering all aspects of implementation protocols," he said. Giving updates on the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, he said that "1,46,598 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6 pm today and 123 adverse event following immunisation were reported till 6 pm on the eighth day of the vaccination drive." No case of serious or severe adverse event following immunisation or death attributable to vaccination has been reported till date, the official said. "Total six deaths have been reported so far (post-vaccination). In the last 24 hours, a person aged 56 years, a resident of Gurgaon, has died. The postmortem confirms that cardio-pulmonary disease was the reason for her death and it was not related to vaccination. None of these deaths have been causally linked with Covid-19 vaccination," he said. Agnani said 11 hospitalisations post vaccinations have been reported till date. "About 0.0007 per cent people have recorded hospitalisation against vaccinations. In the last 24 hours, one person has been hospitalised at a government hospital in Guntur in Andhra Pradesh who was vaccinated on January 20," he said. Agnani said a training of Immunization Programme Managers of 13 countries -- Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Seychelles and Sri Lanka -- using Indian vaccines was conducted by the health ministry, covering all aspects of vaccine roll-out, over two days. Of the 1,46,598 vaccinations carried out on Saturday, the highest number of people were inoculated in Gujarat (22,063) followed by Maharashtra (21,751), Odisha (14,892), Bihar (12,165) and Andhra Pradesh (11,562), according to ministry data.
